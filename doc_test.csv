Paine asserts that mankind was originally in a state of equality, and, therefore, present inequalities must have been brought about by some circumstance. Paine says that a common distinction that lacks any natural or religious basis, is the division between kings and their subjects. This distinction, unlike those between male and female or good and evil, is not one ""of heaven,"" and Paine wishes to inquire into its origin and its consequences.

Originally, Paine says, there were no kings in the world. Then, the ancient Jews copied the custom from the ""heathens"" who surrounded them. This was a grave mistake, and Paine maintains that in establishing a king for themselves, the Jews sinned. Man is supposed to have only God ruling over him, and to introduce a king, who in ruling over the people is like a God, is a grave misdeed. Eventually, Paine says, the Jewish people asked the prophet Samuel for a king. Samuel attempted dissuade the people, but they insisted that they wanted to have a King like the other nations, and God assented, even though he thought it evil that the people should want someone other than God to rule over them.

Having considered the biblical origin of monarchy, Paine concludes that it is a practice begun in sinfulness. The many pages of scriptural evidence make it clear that God stands in opposition to monarchy. Paine moves on to attack the notion of the hereditary succession of the monarchy. Paine argues that, since all men are born equal, no man could have the right to establish his family as forever presiding over others. Even if a person deserves certain honors, his children may not deserve them, and that person has no right to pass those honors on.

Paine also observes that the recent kings of England have mostly been bad, which he says should indicate, even to those who favor hereditary succession, that the present line of kings does not exercise legitimate power.

Paine wonders where the power of kings originally comes from, and decides that this power is always based on one of three things: election, random selection, or usurpation. Paine says that if a king is chosen by election, this means all future kings should be chosen in the same way, and if the king usurped his throne, then the entire reign is illegitimate. Any way you look at it, hereditary succession is not valid. Paine adds that hereditary succession brings other evils with it. For example, people who see themselves as born into an elite existence are often ""ignorant and unfit."" Lastly, Paine refutes the theory that hereditary succession reduces civil wars, as there have been at least eight civil wars and nineteen rebellions in Britain's history. Monarchy and hereditary succession, Paine concludes have produced nothing in the world but bad governance and bloodshed.

To the contemporary reader, Paine's slogging through mounds of biblical evidence might seem less interesting and less relevant, but in Paine's time, the bible shaped opinions on most matters. It was not uncommon to believe that kings ruled by divine right, and for this reason, many were hesitant to revolt against a King—after all, if the king's power was genuinely divine, a revolt against the king was akin to a revolt against God. Paine tries to undercut this line of thinking by attacking it on its own terms, and presenting Biblical passages that reject the idea of a divinely appointed monarchy. In this case, Paine presents an arsenal of Biblical evidence to show that monarchy is neither a natural nor a preferable institution."
http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~stanlick/rights1.html	"A thoroughly Enlightenment view:  the past was a reign of ignorance, superstition and tyranny.  The present and future are characterized by wisdom, reason, and freedom.

From Common Sense:  Paine's view of monarchy - ""It was the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry."" 

     Since Paine held that all human beings are born equals, ""no one by birth could have a right to set up his own family in perpetual preference to all others for ever, and thought himself might deserve some decent degree of honors of his contemporaries, yet his descendants might be far too unworthy to inherit them."" 

     Those who claim that England began through kingship (in William the Conqueror) in some honorable way are missing out on this:  ""No man in his senses can say that their claim under William the Conqueror is a very honorable one.  A French bastard landing with an amred banditti, and establishing himself king of England against the consent of the natives, is in plain terms a very paltry rascally original."" 

     Some will claim that kingship is a safeguard against war.  Paine's view:  ""Were this true, it would be weighty; whereas, it is the most barefaced falsity every imposed upon mankind."" 

     Some have argued that England had a right to rule because it originally ruled over America.  Paine's response:  ""Even brutes do not devour their young; nor savages make war upon their families"" and ""The first king of England, of the present line . . . was a Frenchman, and half the peers of England are descendants from the same country; wherefore by the same method of reasoning, England ought to be governed by France.""

p. 40 - view of the sources of goverment: 

            a.  Superstition 

            b.  Power 

            c.  Common interest

p. 53:  Why hereditary legislators are impossible.  Further, ""a body of men holding themselves accountable to nobody, ought not to be trusted by anybody.""

Political Messianism:  Social and political revolution will remove evil and create a new and sinless, natural humanity. 



If government is founded on appropriate principles, the entire problem of social life would be solved.

Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness. 

     We are incapable of supplying all of our own needs.  Common interest is the principle forming society and holding it together.

From Common Sense:  Society and government have different origins.  Society is founded on wants and government on wickedness.  Society promotes happiness by ""uniting our affections"" while government ""restrains our vices.  The one encourages intercourse, the other creates distinctions.  The first is a patron, the last a punisher.""  Government is, in short, at best a necessary evil (at worst, it is an intolerable evil).

Paine's view was essentially that we are naturally sociable because of our desires; and due to economic self-interest, the more perfect a civilization is, the less government it will need because society will be peaceful as a result of fulfilled needs. 

    What of the French Revolution?  How do we explain the violence there?  See p. 29, text:  comment regarding the people learning terror by being terrorized.

Less government is best.  Progress is in the direction of less government. 

 Is Paine consistent on this point?  In Part II, he puts forth proposals such that public funds can be used to help the poor.  He recommended that money be used to educate the children of the poor, to support the old and sick, and a tax should be imposed on large estates to abolish them.  Isn't this government action to redistribute funds???  The editor, G. Claeys, comments:  ""Instead of government being merely a negative restraining force assisting public order, it was now to foster greater social justice and equality and inhibit entrenched social privilege.""  ""Paine saw no need for the simple equality of traditional republicanism.  But neither was he willing to see the modern republic subverted by gross inequality."" 

    See text, p. 15, last paragr:  Can this comment be used also as a critique of ""patterned principles"" of justice? 

        p. 17:  ""It requires but a very small glance of thought to perceive, that altho' laws made in one generation often continue in force through succeeding generations, yet that they continue to derive their force from the consent of the living.  A law not repealed continues in force, not because it cannot be repealed, but because it is not repealed; and the non-repealing passes for consent.""

Toleration:  see. p. 55:  toleration is not the opposite of intolerance.  Toleration is the counterfeit of it.  Intolerance ""assumes to itself the right of with-holding Liberty of Conscience, and the other of granting it."" 

    Reference to different religious denominations.  What is the result of toleration on them? 

           Paine's view of the benignity of all religions until they become part of the State.

""Government is nothing more than a national association acting on the principles of society."" 

     The principles of society are the laws of nature. 

             Each generation has the right to choose its own form of government.  This is grounded in the notion of natural rights granted to each individual by God.  Such rights are inherited equally simply by virtue of each person's humanity. 

     The point of government is to serve the self-interest of the people. 

         The primary point is rights; duties are minimal - they are basically simply to guarantee to others the same rights one has for himself. 

                DUTIES:  see. p. 82:  That a declaration of rights is by reciprocity a declaration of duties.

Natural rights are intellectual rights - acting as an individual for one's own comfort and happiness - that are not injurious to the rights of others. 

    p. 39 - meaning of 'natural rights' - those that are executable, enforceable, by the individual. 

 Civil Rights are founded on natural rights - civil rights are the rights one cannot naturally secure for himself.  These are security and protection. 

    p. 39 - meaning of civil rights - the power of the individual to execute them is defective.

Society does grant rights to anyone.  ""Every man is a proprietor in society, and draws on the capital as a matter of right."" 

            It follows that: 

                1.  All civil rights grow out of natural rights. 

                2.  Civil power becomes competent as defender of natural rights of which the individual is incapable of securing. 

                3.  The power produced from the aggregate of individuals can't be used to invade natural rights.

From Common Sense:  ""Were the impulises of conscience clear, uniform, and irresisibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least.  Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest beneift, is preferable to all others."" 

     Consider the government of Britain:  the king is monarch; the peers are aristocratical; the commons are those on whom the freedom of England depends.  The British consider the commons to be a check upon the king.  If this is the case, it means: 

     1) The king is not to be trusted - ""A thirst for absolute power is the natural disease of monarchy."" 

     2) The commons are ""either wiser or more worthy of confidence than the crown."" 

 At the same time that England is governed this way, consider this:  the commons can check the king by witholding supplies; but then the king can check the commons by rejecting their other bills.  For Paine, this is absurdity:  ""it again supposes that the king is wiser than those whom it has already supposed to be wiser than him.  A mere absurdity!""

Does Paine's claim that heredity is not an appropriate claim to rule clash with his argument that inheriting natural rights from God gives mankind the right to rule themselves??? 

    See p. 37:  ""The fact is, that portions of antiuqity, by proving every thing, establish nothing.  It is authority against authority all the way, till we come to the divine origin of the rights of man at the creation."" 

     Does Paine's position guarantee the rights of minorities?  How about the notion that majority vote will lead to the good or the right?

Natural rights are given to man by God at creation and are inviolable.

The social contract does not create government, but a civil community, a sovereign nation.  The nation has an inherent and inviolable right to abolish any form of government that it finds inconvenient.

see p. 41.  Why government is not a contract,compact between the people and government.  Constitutions are antecedent to governments.  Therefore (p. 43), governments cannot alter themselves.  Would lead to arbitrary government. 

    p. 59:  That laws exist prior to government.

Government is nothing more than an agent of the people.  This is popular sovereignty - there is no claim to authority by government powers (the people who are weilding power) that can trump the rights of the people to remove governors from power and change the form of government.

Hereditary government is tyranny.  It is slavery.  From American Crisis, I:  ""There are persons, too, who see not the full extent of the evil which threatens them; they solace themsleves with hopes that the enemy, if he succeed, will be merciful.  It is the madness of folly, to expect mercy from those who have refused to do justice; and even mercy, where conquest is the object, is only a trick of war; the cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the world, and we ought to guard equally against both."" 

     Paine commented that:  ""Britain, as a nation, is, in my inmost belief, the greatest and most ungrateful offender against God on the face of the whole earth"" (Am. Crisis, II).  Further, monarchy is ""too debasing to the dignity of man.""

Representative government is the only legitimate form of government because it is founded on the natural right of each person to govern himself.  So, it follows that each person has the right to vote and engage in government affairs even if he is propertyless.

Paine argued for fair taxes, and that representative government such as that in America would preclude wars.  High taxation creates poverty and is the result of aristocracy and monarchy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Sense_(pamphlet)	"Common Sense[1] is a pamphlet written by Thomas Paine in 1775–76 that inspired people in the Thirteen Colonies to declare and fight for independence from Great Britain in the summer of 1776. The pamphlet explained the advantages of and the need for immediate independence in clear, simple language. It was published anonymously on January 10, 1776, at the beginning of the American Revolution and became an immediate sensation. It was sold and distributed widely and read aloud at taverns and meeting places.

Washington had it read to all his troops, which at the time had surrounded the British army in Boston. In proportion to the population of the colonies at that time (2.5 million), it had the largest sale and circulation of any book published in American history.[2] As of 2006, it remains the all-time best selling American title.[3]

Common Sense presented the American colonists with an argument for freedom from British rule at a time when the question of whether or not to seek independence was the central issue of the day. Paine wrote and reasoned in a style that common people understood. Forgoing the philosophical and Latin references used by Enlightenment era writers, he structured Common Sense as if it were a sermon, and relied on Biblical references to make his case to the people.[4] He connected independence with common dissenting Protestant beliefs as a means to present a distinctly American political identity.[5] Historian Gordon S. Wood described Common Sense as ""the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era"".[6]

Thomas Paine began writing Common Sense in late 1775 under the working title of Plain Truth. With Benjamin Rush, who helped him edit it, publish it, and suggested the final title, Paine developed his ideas into a forty-eight page pamphlet. He published Common Sense anonymously because of its treasonable content. Rush recommended the printer Robert Bell, promising Paine that, where other printers might say no because of the content of the pamphlet, Bell would not hesitate nor delay its printing. Paine and Bell had a falling out, but Bell still felt strongly about printing a second edition. Bell added the phrase ""Written by an Englishman"" to his second edition without Paine's permission.[7] Paine had stressed that it was ""the Doctrine, not the man"" that was important. Paine wanted to remain anonymous for as long as possible and felt that even such a general phrase as Bell's addition would take attention away from the ideas in his pamphlet.[7]

This did not seem to matter; printed by Bell, Common Sense sold almost 100,000 copies in 1776,[8] and according to Paine, 120,000 copies were sold in the first three months. One biographer estimates that 500,000 copies sold in the first year (in both America and Europe – predominantly France and Britain), and another writes that Paine's pamphlet went through twenty-five published editions in the first year alone.[6][9]

Aside from the printed pamphlet itself, there were many handwritten summaries and whole copies circulated. At least one newspaper, the Connecticut Courant, printed the entire pamphlet in its February 19, 1776, issue and there may have been others that did the same.[10] While it is difficult to achieve a fixed figure for the number of circulated copies, what is certain is that Paine's words reached far and wide out to most of America's 2.5 million colonists. His pamphlet was read at countless town meetings and gatherings even to those who could not read.

Paine managed to carefully maintain his anonymity, even during potent newspaper polemics generated by Robert Bell, for nearly three months. His name did not become officially connected with the independence controversy until March 30, 1776.[11] He donated his royalties from Common Sense to George Washington's Continental Army, saying:

As the controversy with Bell, which only served to fuel the pamphlet's sale and distribution, wore on, Paine publicly repudiated his copyright to give all colonial printers the legal right to issue their own edition.[12]

Four sections are noted on the title page, which quotes James Thomson's poem, ""Liberty"" (1735–36):

Paine begins this section by making a distinction between society and government, and then goes on to consider the relationship between government and society in a state of ""natural liberty"". He next tells a story of a few isolated people living in nature without government, and explains that the people find it easier to live together rather than apart; thus, they create a society. As the society grows, problems arise, and the people meet to make regulations in order to mitigate the problems. As the society continues to grow, a government becomes necessary to enforce these regulations, which over time, turn into laws. Soon, there are so many people within the society that they cannot all gather in one place to make the laws, so they begin holding elections. This, Paine argues, is the best balance between government and society. Having created this model of what the balance should be, Paine goes on to consider the Constitution of the United Kingdom.

Paine finds two tyrannies in the English constitution; monarchical and aristocratic tyranny, in the king and peers, who rule by heredity and contribute nothing to the people. Paine goes on to criticize the English constitution by examining the relationship between the king, the peers, and the commons.

In the second section Paine considers monarchy first from a biblical perspective, then from a historical perspective. He begins by arguing that all men are equal at creation and, therefore, the distinction between kings and subjects is a false one. Several Bible verses are posed to support this claim. Paine then examines some of the problems that kings and monarchies have caused in the past and concludes:

In this section, Paine also attacks one type of ""mixed state"" – the constitutional monarchy promoted by John Locke in which the powers of government are separated between a Parliament or Congress that makes the laws, and a monarch who executes them. The constitutional monarchy, according to Locke, would limit the powers of the king sufficiently to ensure that the realm would remain lawful rather than easily becoming tyrannical. According to Paine, however, such limits are insufficient. In the mixed state, power will tend to concentrate into the hands of the monarch, permitting him eventually to transcend any limitations placed upon him. Paine questions why the supporters of the mixed state, since they concede that the power of the monarch is dangerous, wish to include a monarch in their scheme of government in the first place.

In the third section Paine examines the hostilities between England and the American colonies and argues that the best course of action is independence. Paine proposes a Continental Charter (or Charter of the United Colonies) that would be an American Magna Carta. Paine writes that a Continental Charter ""should come from some intermediate body between the Congress and the people"" and outlines a Continental Conference that could draft a Continental Charter.[14] Each colony would hold elections for five representatives. These five would be accompanied by two members of the assembly of colonies, for a total of seven representatives from each colony in the Continental Conference. The Continental Conference would then meet and draft a Continental Charter that would secure “freedom and property to all men, and… the free exercise of religion.”[14] The Continental Charter would also outline a new national government, which Paine thought would take the form of a Congress.

Thomas Paine suggested that a congress may be created in the following way: each colony should be divided in districts; each district would ""send a proper number of delegates to Congress"".[14] Paine thought that each colony should send at least 30 delegates to Congress, and that the total number of delegates in Congress should be at least 390. The Congress would meet annually, and elect a president. Each colony would be put into a lottery; the president would be elected, by the whole congress, from the delegation of the colony that was selected in the lottery. After a colony was selected, it would be removed from subsequent lotteries until all of the colonies had been selected, at which point the lottery would start anew. Electing a president or passing a law would require three-fifths of the congress.

The fourth section of the pamphlet includes Paine's optimistic view of America's military potential at the time of the revolution. For example, he spends pages describing how colonial shipyards, by using the large amounts of lumber available in the country, could quickly create a navy that could rival the Royal Navy.

There were at least two reasons why Paine's brief pamphlet is believed to be ""the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era"".[6] First, while the average colonist was more educated than their European counterpart, European and colonial elites agreed that common people had no place in government or political debates. Common Sense targeted a popular audience and was written in a straightforward and simple way, so Paine's political ideas were made tangible and available to a common audience. This brought average colonists into political debate, which created a whole new political language.[15] Those colonists who had not been taught how to read could hear the words of Common Sense at public gatherings, so even they were brought into this new political world. Paine's fresh style of political writing avoided use of complex Latin phrases and instead opted for a more direct, concise style that helped make the information accessible to everyone who read or heard its ideas.

The second reason involves the way the vast majority of colonists felt about the idea of independence from British rule. Before Common Sense was published, except for a few radical thinkers, the people of the American colonies were ""on the fence"" about independence. Individuals were in conflict with themselves, and there were those who leaned toward reconciliation with the British crown. George Trevelyan in his History of the American Revolution had this to say about Paine's pamphlet:

There were those in high places who, while in agreement with Paine's sentiments, voiced criticism of his method. John Adams, who would succeed George Washington to become the new nation's second president, in his Thoughts on Government wrote that Paine's ideal sketched in Common Sense was ""so democratical, without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise, that it must produce confusion and every evil work"".[16] In spite of Adams' formidable influence most people praised Paine's brief booklet. The editors of The Thomas Paine Reader, Michael Foot and Isaac Kramnick, in their introduction to Common Sense wrote:

The impact of Common Sense was to influence American colonists, both educated and uneducated, to come down from their fences, to feel they were part of a greater whole, and to embrace independence from the British monarchy.[8]"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_(United_States_coin)	"A nickel, in American usage, is a five-cent coin struck by the United States Mint. Composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel, the piece has been issued since 1866.

The silver half dime, equal to five cents, had been issued since the 1790s. The American Civil War caused economic hardship, driving gold and silver from circulation; in response, in place of low-value coins, the government at first issued paper currency. In 1865, Congress abolished the five-cent fractional currency note after Spencer M. Clark, head of the Currency Bureau (today the Bureau of Engraving and Printing), placed his own portrait on the denomination. After successful introduction of two-cent and three-cent pieces without precious metal, Congress also authorized a five-cent piece consisting of base metal; the Mint began striking this version in 1866.

The initial design of the Shield nickel was struck from 1866 until 1883, then was replaced by the Liberty Head nickel. The Buffalo nickel was introduced in 1913 as part of a drive to increase the beauty of American coinage; in 1938, the Jefferson nickel followed. In 2004 and 2005, special designs in honor of the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition were issued. In 2006, the Mint reverted to using Jefferson nickel designer Felix Schlag's original reverse (or ""tails"" side), although a new obverse, by Jamie Franki, was substituted. As of the end of FY 2013, it cost more than nine cents to produce a nickel;[1] the Mint is exploring the possibility of reducing cost by using less expensive metals.

The silver half disme (as the half dime, pronounced the same, was first called) was one of the denominations prescribed by the Mint Act of 1792, its weight and fineness were set by law. The first pieces under federal authority were half dismes, struck in 1792 in the cellar of John Harper, a saw maker; as the first federal mint was still under construction in Philadelphia, this took place locally at Sixth and Cherry Streets. The dies were engraved by Adam Eckfeldt, who a half-century later recalled the silver for the half dimes was supplied by President George Washington, and that the 1,500 coins struck from the bullion were given to Washington's Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, for distribution to important people, both in the US and overseas. By legend, President Washington supplied silverware from his home, Mount Vernon, to provide bullion for the coins. In his annual message to Congress in late 1792, Washington noted the ongoing construction of a mint building and stated: ""There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes, the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.""

In 1793, the newly established Philadelphia Mint began striking cents and half cents. Coinage of precious metal was delayed; Congress required the assayer and chief coiner to each post a security bond of $10,000, a huge sum in 1793. In 1794, Congress lowered the chief coiner's bond to $5,000, and the assayer's to $1,000; President Washington's appointees to those positions were thus able to qualify and take office. Subsequently, silver coinage began that year.

The half dime was struck to various designs by Mint Engraver Robert Scot from 1794 until 1805, though none were dated 1798, 1799, or 1804. By 1804, silver US coins were heavily exported, as they could be exchanged at par in the West Indies with heavier Spanish coins, which were then imported as bullion and deposited at the Mint for melting and restriking. In response, in 1804 the US stopped striking silver dollars; issuance of the half dime was discontinued from 1805 until 1829. In 1807, mint Director Robert Patterson in a letter explained to Jefferson (by then president) ""nearly the whole of our Silver Bullion (chiefly Spanish dollars) come through the Banks, and it is very seldom that they will consent to take any coin less than half dollars.""

Beginning in 1829, the silver five-cent piece was again struck; beginning in 1837, its fineness was increased from .8924 to .900. Also in 1837, the half dime's obverse design changed from one by William Kneass, depicting a bust of Liberty, to one that featured a seated Liberty by Christian Gobrecht; until its abolition in 1873, the half dime would bear modifications of this design. In 1851, it ceased to be the smallest US silver coin as a three cent piece was issued by the Mint.

The Civil War caused most American coins to vanish from circulation, with the gap filled by such means as merchant tokens, encased postage stamps, and United States fractional currency, issued in denominations as low as three cents. Although specie (gold or silver coins) was hoarded or exported, the copper-nickel cent, then the only base metal denomination being struck, also vanished. In 1864, Congress began the process of restoring coins to circulation by abolishing the three-cent note and authorizing bronze cents and two-cent pieces, with low intrinsic values, to be struck. These new coins initially proved popular, though the two-cent piece soon faded from circulation. On March 3, 1865, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Mint to strike three-cent pieces of 75% copper and 25% nickel.

In 1864, Congress authorized a third series of fractional currency notes. The five-cent note was to bear a depiction of ""Clark"", but Congress was appalled when the issue came out not with a portrait of William Clark, the explorer, but Spencer M. Clark, head of the Currency Bureau. According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, Congress's ""immediate infuriated response was to pass a law retiring the five-cent denomination, and another to forbid portrayal of any living person on federal coins or currency."" Clark kept his job only because of the personal intervention of Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase.

Mint Director James Pollock had been opposed to striking coins containing nickel, but in view of the initial success of the copper-nickel three-cent piece, he became an advocate of striking five-cent pieces in the same metals. In his 1865 report, Pollock wrote, ""From this nickel alloy, a coin for the denomination of five cents, and which would be a popular substitute for the five cent note, could easily be made ... [The five-cent coin should be struck in base metal] only until the resumption of specie payments ... in time of peace ... coins of inferior alloy should not be permitted to take the place permanently of silver in the coinage of pieces above the denomination of three cents.""

Industrialist Joseph Wharton had a near-monopoly on the mining of nickel in the United States, and sought to promote its use in coinage. He was also highly influential in Congress. His friends there, though they had failed to obtain the metal's use for the two-cent piece, had been more successful with the base-metal three-cent coin. Pollock prepared a bill authorizing a five-cent coin of the same alloy as the three-cent piece, with a total weight not to exceed 60 grains (3.9 g). At the committee stage in the House of Representatives, the weight was amended to 77.19 grains (5.00 g), ostensibly to make the weight equal to five grams in the metric system but more likely so that Wharton could sell more nickel. This made the new coin heavy, in terms of weight per $.01 of face value, compared to the three-cent copper-nickel coin. The bill passed without debate on May 16, 1866. The new copper-nickel coin was legal tender for up to one dollar, and would be paid out by the Treasury in exchange for coin of the United States, excluding the half cent, cent and two-cent. It was redeemable in lots of $100 for banknotes. Fractional currency in denominations of less than ten cents was withdrawn.

In anticipation of the approval of the new five-cent coin, the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern coins in 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This has come to be known as the Shield nickel.

The new coins proved difficult to produce; owing to the hardness of the planchet, the coins were not of high quality and the life of the striking dies was brief. The design was widely criticized; Wharton described the obverse as suggesting ""a tombstone surmounted by a cross and overhung by weeping willows."" The American Journal of Numismatics described the Shield nickel as ""the ugliest of all known coins"". The rays were eliminated from the reverse design in 1867, in the hope of eliminating some of the production problems. The design change created confusion among the population—many people assumed that one design or the other was a counterfeit—and the Mint briefly considered abandoning the shield design entirely. After heavy production in its first years, by late 1869, enough nickels had been struck to meet the needs of commerce; fewer were coined in the following years.

The new coins tended to accumulate in the hands of merchants beyond the legal tender limit, but banks refused to accept them beyond the one-dollar maximum. Storeowners were forced to discount the coins to brokers.Postmasters, compelled by law to accept the coins, found that the Treasury would not accept them as deposits except in lots of $100, in accordance with the authorizing statute. In 1871, Congress alleviated the problem by passing legislation allowing the Treasury to redeem unlimited quantities of nickels and other low-denomination coins when presented in lots of not less than $20. It was not until 1933, long after the shield design passed from the scene, that the nickel was made legal tender without limit.

Half dimes continued to be struck, at both the Philadelphia and the San Francisco Mint, until the series was ended by the Coinage Act of 1873. Despite the abolition, the silver pieces continued to circulate in the West, where silver or gold coins were preferred, throughout the remainder of the 19th century. Improved economic conditions, combined with low silver prices, brought large quantities of hoarded silver coinage, including half dimes, into circulation beginning in April 1876. In late 1876, production of the Shield nickel was halted. No Shield nickels were struck in 1877 or 1878, excepting proof specimens for collectors. As the Treasury had a large stock of nickels in storage, only small numbers were struck over the next few years; full-scale production did not resume until December 1881.

With production of nickels lagging in the late 1870s, and with minimal strikings of the copper-nickel three-cent piece, Wharton sought to increase the use of nickel at the Mint. The bronze cent represented a major portion of the Mint's production, and Wharton began to lobby for the piece to be struck in copper-nickel, as it had been from 1857 until 1864. In 1881, this lobbying led Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Archibald Loudon Snowden to order Mint Engraver Charles Barber to produce uniform designs for a new cent, three-cent piece, and five-cent piece. Snowden required that the new coins depict the head of Liberty with the legend and the date, with the nickel's reverse to have a wreath of wheat, cotton, and corn around a Roman numeral ""V"" for ""5"", to denote the denomination. Under the proposal, the nickel would retain its weight of 5 grams (0.18 oz), but its diameter would be increased to 22 millimeters (0.87 in).

Barber duly produced the required designs. Snowden eventually decided against a new cent or three-cent piece, but Barber continued work on the nickel, with the size adjusted to 21.21 millimeters (0.835 in). When specimens were sent to Washington for routine approval by Treasury Secretary Charles J. Folger, to Snowden's surprise, they were rejected. The secretary, on review of the coinage statutes, had realized that the laws required "" "" to appear on the reverse, not the obverse where Barber had placed it. Barber modified his design accordingly, and the coin was ready for striking in early 1883. However, by then, Shield nickels dated 1883 had already been coined. To ensure these pieces would not be hoarded for their rarity, Mint officials kept the two designs in production side by side for several months.

Criminals soon realized that the new nickel, which lacked the word "" "", was close in size to the five-dollar gold piece, and if they were to plate the nickel with gold, it might be passed for five dollars. Some coins were even given a reeded edge by fraudsters, making them appear more like the gold coins. The Mint halted production of the new coins; production of Shield nickels continued. Barber was told to modify his work, which he did, moving other design elements to accommodate the word "" "" at the bottom of the reverse. The revised nickel was issued on June 26, 1883, the date on which production of the Shield nickel was finally stopped. The public promptly hoarded the ""centless"" nickels, believing the Treasury Department intended to recall them, and that they would become rare.

The Liberty Head nickel was heavily struck during its 30-year run, except during economic downturns in 1885–1886 and in 1894, when only small numbers were struck. In 1890, Congress ended production of the three-cent piece, leaving the five-cent coin as the only one in copper nickel. That year, Congress also allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the redesign of United States coins, if the former design had been struck for at least 25 years. Although the nickel and silver dollar had been redesigned within the previous quarter-century, a provision in the latter act made them eligible for immediate redesign. In 1896, pattern nickels were struck for the first time since 1885, when experimental, holed coins had been tested; however, no redesign took place.

Coin-operated machines to vend food, for amusement, and for gambling became popular in the 1890s. Such machines could be placed on otherwise unused floor space in businesses, required little maintenance, and brought in money for owners. Beginning about 1898, coin-operated mechanical pianos also became popular. The Mills Novelty Company was a leading producer of such devices; by 1906 it was producing machines ranging from a mechanically played violin to fortune-telling devices. While some machines took cents or other denominations, the nickel was the coin of choice for these machines.

Among the innovations in business caused by the use of the nickel in coin-operated machines was the automat, in which patrons would serve themselves by inserting a coin (initially a nickel, though by the 1950s a higher denomination was needed) into a mechanism, turning a handle, and removing a sandwich or dessert. These restaurants were first established in Germany, but were popularized in the United States by, among other firms, Horn & Hardart. A type of business which took its name from the coin was the nickelodeon cinema, where a nickel bought admission to view a series of one-reel short films, generally about 12 minutes in length, which ran continuously from early afternoon until late at night, with the patron free to remain as long as he liked. Although another denomination gave the penny arcade its name, the nickel was commonly used there as well.

Few nickels had circulated in the western states before the 1880s (people there preferred silver and gold coins); interest in the new Liberty Head design had led to increasing use of nickels there. Good economic conditions and high demand for nickels for use in coin-operated devices caused the piece to circulate throughout the nation by 1900. That year, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to quintuple the Mint's appropriation to purchase base metals for striking into nickels and cents. At the time, statutory restrictions permitted production of cents and nickels only at Philadelphia; Roberts' request that Congress allow striking at the other mints was granted in 1906. The Denver and San Francisco Mints began striking nickels in 1912.

The Liberty Head nickel was replaced after 1912, and initially there was no indication that 1913-dated pieces with that design existed. In December 1919, a coin dealer, Samuel W. Brown, placed advertisements in coin publications, offering to buy 1913 Liberty Head nickels. The following August, Brown appeared at the annual American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention bearing such a piece. Brown claimed that a master die had been prepared for 1913 and that these pieces had been run off to test it. As it turned out, Brown possessed five coins, which he eventually sold. After spending fifteen years in the hands of the eccentric Col. E.H.R. Green, the famous Fort Worth, Texas, area collector, the coins were finally dispersed in 1943. Since then, they have had several owners each. Today, two are on public display—at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the ANA's Money Museum in Colorado Springs, while three are owned privately. The most recent sale of a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was in January 2010, when one sold for $3,737,500 in an auction.

It is uncertain how the 1913 nickels came to be made. The Mint's records show no production of 1913 Liberty head nickels, and none were authorized to be made. Dies were prepared in advance and sent to California for a 1913-S Liberty Head nickel coinage, but upon orders from Mint Director Roberts in December 1912 to end the old design, they were returned to Philadelphia. They were received by December 23, and were almost certainly destroyed routinely by early January. Brown had been an employee at the Philadelphia Mint (although this was not known until 1963) and many theories focus suspicion on him.

President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 expressed his dissatisfaction with the artistic state of American coins, and hoped to hire sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens to beautify them. Saint-Gaudens, before his 1907 death, designed a new eagle and double eagle, which entered circulation that year; the cent, quarter eagle, and half eagle were redesigned by other artists and were released into circulation by 1909. That year, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed Barber to make pattern coins for new nickels. Most of these coins featured the first president, George Washington. However, the project was discontinued when Leach left office on November 1, 1909, to be replaced by Abram Andrew.

On May 4, 1911, Eames MacVeagh, son of Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh wrote to his father:

Soon after the MacVeagh letter, Andrew announced that the Mint would solicit new designs for the nickel. Sculptor James Earle Fraser, who had been an assistant to Saint-Gaudens, approached the Mint, and rapidly produced concepts and designs. Mint Director George Roberts, who had returned to office in place of Andrew, initially favored a design featuring Lincoln, but Fraser soon developed a design featuring a Native American on one side and a bison on the other. Secretary MacVeagh wrote, ""Tell him that of the three sketches which he submitted we would like to use the sketch of the head of the Indian and the sketch of the buffalo."" In July 1912, news of the new nickel became public, and coin-operated machine manufacturers sought information. Clarence Hobbs of the Hobbs Manufacturing Company, maker of counterfeit detectors, feared the new nickel would not be passed by his devices. Hobbs demanded various changes to the design, to which the artist was reluctant to agree.

The Hobbs Company continued to interpose objections in 1913. On February 3, Hobbs sent Roberts a lengthy list of changes that he wanted in the coin, and the sculptor was required to attend a conference with Hobbs representatives. On the fifth, following the conference, which ended with no agreement, Fraser sent MacVeagh a ten-page letter, complaining that his time was being wasted by the Hobbs Company, and appealing to the Secretary to bring the situation to a close. Secretary MacVeagh agreed to hold a meeting at his office in Washington on February 14. Barber prepared patterns showing what the nickel would look like if the changes demanded by Hobbs were made. MacVeagh conducted the meeting much like a legal hearing, and issued a letter the following day. The secretary noted that no other firm had complained, that the Hobbs mechanism had not been widely sold, and that the changes demanded—a clear space around the rim and the flattening of the Indian's cheekbone—would affect the artistic merit of the piece. MacVeagh concluded, ""You will please, therefore, proceed with the coinage of the new nickel.""

The coins were officially released to circulation on March 4, 1913, and quickly gained positive comments for depicting truly American themes. However, The New York Times stated in an editorial that ""The new 'nickel' is a striking example of what a coin intended for wide circulation should not be ...[it] is not pleasing to look at when new and shiny, and will be an abomination when old and dull.""The Numismatist, in March and May 1913 editorials, gave the new coin a lukewarm review, suggesting that the Indian's head be reduced in size and the bison be eliminated from the reverse.

Dies for the new design proved to break quickly. Barber made proposed revisions, which Fraser approved after being sent samples. These changes enlarged the legend ""FIVE CENTS"" and changed the ground on which the bison stands from a hill to flat ground. According to data compiled by numismatic historian David Lange from the National Archives, the changes to what are known as Type II nickels (with the originals Type I) actually decreased the die life. A problem not addressed was the exposure of the date to wear; many Buffalo nickels today have the date worn away.

In January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for a new nickel design, to feature early president Thomas Jefferson on the obverse, and Jefferson's home, Monticello on the reverse. The last Buffalo nickels were struck in April 1938 at the Denver Mint, the only mint to strike them that year.

The identities of the models for the Native American on the obverse and for the bison on the reverse are not known with certainty. Fraser stressed that the Indian was a type, rather than based on a specific individual, and identified various Native Americans as models, not always consistently, including Iron Tail, Two Moons, and Big Tree (of the Kiowa people). There have been other claimants, the most prominent being John Big Tree, a Seneca, who made many public appearances as the ""nickel Indian"" until his death in 1967. Fraser recounted that the animal on the reverse was an American bison, Black Diamond, whom he stated lived at the Bronx Zoo, and also described the model simply as a bison at the Bronx Zoo. However, Black Diamond was never at the Bronx Zoo, but instead lived at the Central Park Zoo (both facilities are in New York City) until the animal was sold and slaughtered in 1915. The placement of the horns on the still-extant mounted head of Black Diamond differs from that of the bison on the nickel.

From its inception, the coin was referred to as the ""Buffalo nickel"", reflecting the common misnomer for the bison. The numismatic publication with the greatest circulation, Coin World, calls it an Indian head nickel, while R.S. Yeoman's Red Book refers to it as an ""Indian Head or Buffalo type"".

When the Buffalo nickel had been struck for 25 years and could be replaced without an act of Congress, the Mint moved quickly to replace it. Although the Fraser design is popular today among numismatists, it did not enjoy that status in 1938, and there was no public outcry at the decision. In January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for the new nickel design, with the winner to receive a prize of $1,000. Anticipating the 1943 bicentennial of Jefferson's birth, competitors were to place his portrait on the obverse, and a depiction of his house Monticello on the reverse.

On April 24, Felix Schlag was announced as the winner. His design featured the portrayal of Jefferson which would be used on the nickel until 2004, closely conforming to the former president's bust by sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, which is to be found in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. However, the model differs from the nickel that was struck for circulation because it featured a view of Monticello from an angle, and a style of lettering officials did not like; Schlag was required to change both. Either through a misunderstanding or an oversight, Schlag did not include his initials in the design; they would not be added until 1966. Production began on October 3, 1938; they were released into circulation on November 15. According to contemporary accounts, the Jefferson nickel was initially hoarded, and it was not until 1940 that it was commonly seen in circulation.

With the entry of the United States into World War II, nickel became a critical war material, and the Mint sought to reduce its use of the metal. On March 27, 1942, Congress authorized a nickel made of 50% copper and 50% silver, but gave the Mint the authority to vary the proportions, or add other metals, in the public interest. The Mint's greatest concern was in finding an alloy that would use no nickel, but still satisfy counterfeit detectors in vending machines. An alloy of 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese proved suitable, and this alloy began to be coined into nickels from October 1942. In the hope of making them easy to sort out and withdraw after the war, the Mint struck all ""war nickels"" with a large mint mark appearing above Monticello. The mint mark P for Philadelphia was the first time that mint's mark had appeared on a US coin. The prewar composition returned in 1946; all nickels struck since then have been in 75% copper and 25% nickel.

In 1966, a small change was made to the design to add the initials of the designer (FS) to the obverse, underneath Jefferson's portrait. In commemoration of that change, two specimen 1966 nickels with the initials were struck and presented to him. Coins struck at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack mint marks, which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with copper-nickel. Beginning in 1968, mint marks were again used, and on the nickel were moved to the lower part of the obverse, to the right of Jefferson's bust. From 1971, no nickels were struck for circulation in San Francisco—the 1971-S was the first nickel struck in proof only since 1878.

The Mint had struck circulating commemorative coins for the United States Bicentennial, giving quarters, half dollars, and dollars struck in 1975 and 1976 a dual date, "" "". After Canada issued a successful series of quarters in 1992 honoring its provinces and territories, the Mint obtained congressional permission to issue a series of US quarters honoring American states; they began to be issued in 1999. In 2002, the Mint began to consider redesigning the nickel in honor of the upcoming bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Representative Eric Cantor (Republican-Virginia) did not wish to see Monticello (located in his home state) moved permanently off the nickel. The resultant ""American 5-Cent Coin Design Continuity Act of 2003"", was signed into law on April 23, 2003. Under its terms, the Treasury Secretary could vary the nickel's designs in honor of the 200th anniversary of the Expedition and of the Louisiana Purchase, but the nickel would again feature Jefferson and Monticello beginning in 2006. Unless Congress acts again, every future five-cent coin will feature Jefferson and Monticello.

The Mint used Schlag's obverse in 2004, with two new reverse designs. Mint sculptor-engraver Norman E. Nemeth's adaptation of an Indian Peace Medal struck for Jefferson was the first new design, followed by a depiction by Mint sculptor-engraver Al Maletsky of a keelboat like that used by the Expedition. The 2005 obverse was struck during that year only, with a design by sculptor Joe Fitzgerald based on Houdon's bust of Jefferson. The legend "" "" on the obverse was traced from Jefferson's handwriting in drafting the Declaration of Independence; as the word is never capitalized in that document, Fitzgerald borrowed a capital L from Jefferson's other writings. The reverse for the first half of the year depicted an American bison, recalling the Buffalo nickel and designed by Jamie Franki. The reverse for the second half showed a coastline and the words ""Ocean in view! O! The Joy!"", from a journal entry by William Clark, co-leader of the Expedition. Clark had actually written the word as ""ocian"", but the Mint modernized the spelling.

Another Franki design has, since 2006, been used for the obverse, depicting a view of Jefferson from the front (rather than in profile) based on an 1800 study by Rembrandt Peale, and includes ""Liberty"" in Jefferson's script. According to Acting Mint Director David Lebryk, ""The image of a forward-facing Jefferson is a fitting tribute to [his] vision."" The reverse beginning in 2006 was again Schlag's Monticello design, but newly sharpened by Mint engravers. As Schlag's obverse design, on which his initials were placed in 1966, is no longer used, his initials were placed on the reverse to the right of Monticello.

In the first decade of the 21st century, commodity prices for copper and nickel, which make up the five-cent coin, rose dramatically, pushing the cost of manufacturing a nickel from 3.46 cents in fiscal year 2003 to 10.09 cents in fiscal year 2012. By comparison, a Canadian nickel (which is primarily made of steel) still costs less than its face value to produce as of 2013.[108] In response, Mint Director Henrietta Fore in 2004 asked Congress to fund research into lower-cost alternatives to present coinage metals. Although the initiative lapsed when she left office in 2005, in 2010, Congress passed the Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act, directing the Mint to explore alternatives to the present compositions of the six denominations, from cent to dollar. In 2011, the Mint awarded a contract to study the issue to Concurrent Technologies Corporation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The report in response to the legislation requested additional time to study the issue, ensuring the continuation, for the present, of the existing coinage metals. The Mint expects demand for nickels in commerce to increase from 840 million needed in Fiscal Year 2011 to 1.08 billion in 2015.

Meanwhile, in an attempt to avoid losing large quantities of circulating nickels to melting, the United States Mint introduced new interim rules on December 14, 2006, that criminalized the melting and export of pennies (which as of 2013 cost 1.83 cents to produce) and nickels. Violators of these rules can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000, five years imprisonment, or both. The rules were finalized on April 17, 2007. The melt value of a nickel for some time was more than five cents, including nearing double its face value in May 2007. Since then, the supply and demand of the coin's composition metals have stabilized. A nickel's melt value fell below its face value for several weeks between October and November 2012, and more recently again from late February through April 2013.[113] In February 2014, it was reported that the Mint was conducting experiments to use copper-plated zinc (the same composition used for the United States 1 cent coin) for the nickel.[114]"

All he can dream about is becoming part of the Furious Five, a legendary group of martial arts masters who protect the people. Through a sequence of events Po was chosen as the Dragon Warrior and the newest member of the Furious Five. The members of the Furious Five and their leader, Shifu did not agree with this decision and were reluctant to the change. Shifu begins training Po as the Dragon Warrior and prepping the Furious Five for the battle of their lives against Shifu's old student Tai Long. Tai Long has been locked away in prison for many years, but has vowed to escape so that he can take the Dragon Scroll. This is a scroll that only the Dragon Warrior is able to read, and it is said to possess great powers. Tai Long is able to escape from prison and makes his way to Peaceful Valley, where Po and the Furious Five await. Master Shifu decides that it is time for Po to receive the Dragon Scroll. When they look at it for the first time all they see is a blank scroll with their reflections. Shifu believes that this is a sign that Po is not ready to fight Tai Long, so he sends Po along with the Furious Five to help take the villagers away. While moving the villagers to safety Po runs into his father. Trying to console Po, his father reveals the secret ingredient to the family's famous noodle soup; ""nothing"". Po now understands what the Dragon Scroll really is and knows that it is his destiny to go back and defeat Tai Long. Po returns in the nick of time to save Master Shifu and is able to defeat Tai Long.The villagers are all able to return to Peaceful Valley and continue to live their peaceful lives. Po is now an honorable member of the Furious Five and continues to strive to be the best martial arts master he can be.Kung Fu Panda takes place in a fictional village in ancient China.

He wanted the lead character, Po to go through the hero's journey in the movie. The all-star cast for the movie includes, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Lucy Lou, Seth Rogen and Ian McSheen to name a few. Jack Black did an excellent job of bringing to life the character of Po.

Free lunch was a commonplace term in the USA and, to a lesser extent in Britain, from the mid 19th century onward. It wasn't used to describe handouts of food to the poor and hungry though, it denoted the free food that American saloon keepers used to attract drinkers; for example, this advertisement for a Milwaukee saloon, in The Commercial Advertiser, June 1850:

Free lunches, often cold food but sometimes quite elaborate affairs, were provided for anyone who bought drink. This inducement wasn't popular with the temperance lobby and was also criticized for the same reason that others in the 20th century later introduced the TANSTAAFL idea to economic thinking, that is, saloon customers always ended up paying for the food in the price of the drinks they were obliged to consume. Indeed, some saloon keepers were prosecuted for false advertising of free lunch as customers couldn't partake of it without first paying money to the saloon.

It was into this context that the economic theorists enter the fray and 'there's no such thing as a free lunch' is coined. It isn't known who coined the phrase. It certainly wasn't the economist Milton Friedman, who was much associated with the term. He was a celebrated Nobel Prize-winning economist and his monetarist theories were highly influential on the Reagan and Thatcher administrations in the 1980s and 90s. Friedman certainly believed that 'there's no such thing as a free lunch' and he published a book with that title in 1975, but wasn't, and never claimed to be, the originator of the phrase.

The phrase appears to have come about in response to the libertarian views of Henry Wallace, the US Vice President between 1941 and 1945. He wrote an article which was originally published by The Atlantic Monthly in which he suggested a post-WWII worldwide economic regime offering ""minimum standards of food, clothing and shelter"" for people throughout the world and offering the opinion that ""If we can afford tremendous sums of money to win the war, we can afford to invest whatever amount it takes to win the peace"". Paul Mallon, a Washington journalist, responded to Wallace's article with a critical piece, published in several US papers, including The Lima News, January 1942:

The first record I can find of the precise phrase there's no such thing as a free lunch, comes following year, in an editorial in The Long Beach Independent, October 1943, again referring to Wallace:

The 'there ain't no such thing as a free lunch' version of the phrase is often reduced to the acronym TANSTAAFL. This is widely associated with the science fiction writer Robert Heinlein. he did used the term several times in his 1966 novel The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, but the coinage of the acronym pre-dates that by at least a quarter of a century. The earliest citation I can find for tanstaafl is from October 1949, when it appeared in a book review published in several US newspapers, including The Independent Record:

http://www.techtimes.com/articles/42910/20150329/pandas-more-social-think-flirt.htm	"Pandas are even more social than once thought — even flirting in a manner similar to human beings. Researchers had believed that they were largely solitary animals, but a new study reveals that pandas lead highly complex social lives.

Five pandas in China's Wolong Nature Reserve were fitted with GPS devices on their collars, allowing researchers to track the movement of the animals in the wild. Michigan State University (MSU) researchers then spent several months collecting and analyzing information on the movement of the pandas.

""Pandas are such an elusive species and it's very hard to observe them in wild, so we haven't had a good picture of where they are from one day to the next,"" said Vanessa Hull from the Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability (CSIS) at MSU.

""Once we got all the data in the computer, we could see where they go and map it. It was so fascinating to sit down and watch their whole year unfold before you like a little window into their world.""

The five pandas include a male named Chuan Chuan, a young female called Long Long, and three adult females: Mei Mei, Zhong Zhong and Pan Pan. The animals were captured, collared and tracked between 2010 and 2012.

Analysis of the tracking data revealed that Mei Mei, Long Long and Chuan Chuan lived near one another in a small section of the forest during several weeks in the autumn. Pandas were believed to only live in close quarters during mating season – March through May – so this finding came as a surprise to scientists. Chuan Chuan, the lone male in the group, covered the greatest area, marking trees with scent glands, which suggests that he may have been searching for females.

Pandas tend to eat away at the bamboo in one region before heading off to another region in search of food. The animals have as many as 20 or 30 home areas within the region they inhabit. Previous investigations have revealed that pandas often follow bamboo supplies from one area to another.

China recently released a report on the state of pandas around the nation, concluding that the population rose a total of 17 percent over the last 10 years. The species faces increasing pressure to survive the loss of habitat, encroachment from humans and global climate change.

""The rise in the population of wild giant pandas is a victory for conservation and definitely one to celebrate,"" said Ginette Hemley, senior vice president of wildlife conservation for World Wildlife Fund.

The study of panda social behavior was published in the Journal of Mammalogy."

http://nickle.org/	"Nickle is a programming language based prototyping environment with powerful programming and scripting capabilities. Nickle supports a variety of datatypes, especially arbitrary precision numbers. The programming language vaguely resembles C. Some things in C which do not translate easily are different, some design choices have been made differently, and a very few features are simply missing.

Nickle provides the functionality of UNIX bc, dc and expr in much-improved form. It is also an ideal environment for prototyping complex algorithms. Nickle's scripting capabilities make it a nice replacement for spreadsheets in some applications, and its numeric features nicely complement the limited numeric functionality of text-oriented languages such as AWK and PERL.

Nickle encourages (but does not require) the developer to use type declarations in programming and on the command line, to allow static type checking. Nickle backs this up with full run-time type checking.

The numeric datatypes within Nickle make it a good choice for the design and implementation of numeric algorithms. Nickle provides three numeric data types: arbitrary precision integers, arbitrary-precision rationals and unbounded floating-point ""reals"" with specifiable precision. These datatypes permit computations which would be difficult or impossible using fixed format numeric datatypes.

Along with the basic numeric datatypes, Nickle includes multi-dimensional arrays, strings, structures, tagged unions and pointers.

Nickle provides support for parallel computation via a simple thread model, along with ancilary datatypes like semaphores and mutexes. These provide an excellent environment for parallel algorithm development.

Nickle also has features inspired by modern languages like Modula 3, ML and Java, such as typed exceptions, first class functions and aggregate values, tagged unions and continuations. In particular, functional programming is reasonably well supported by the language. Still to be implemented is parametric polymorphism and more ADT support.

Nightly snapshots are available. A new snapshot is created early each morning if any changes have been committed to git since the last snapshot was created.

The current version is normally available as a part of the Debian unstable archive. Just 'apt-get update' and 'apt-get install nickle'. Recent releases may also be available from the release directory in .deb, .rpm as well as .tar.gz form. The git master is canonical, though.

There are also stale versions available, although you don't want to use them.

The latest development code is also available through git. Instructions on using the git archive are also provided."

This five-cent coin was called a ""half disme"" (pronounced like ""dime"").  A new five-cent coin, made of nickel (and copper), was created in 1866...but the half disme kept being made of silver until 1873.  So both kinds of five-cent coin were circulating at the same time.

The half disme was much smaller than today's nickel, too.  That's because silver has always cost more than nickel.  The value of silver coins depended on their weight, so the half disme had to be exactly half the weight of a disme.  When Congress decided to make a five-cent coin of nickel and copper, the coin had to be made larger.  This was good, because this nickel was much easier to handle than the tiny silver half disme.

The man on the nickel is President Thomas Jefferson, who took his place there in 1938.  The building on the back of many nickels is called ""Monticello,"" a large home that Jefferson designed and built for himself.  But change can change!  Check out the designs of the Westward Journey Nickel Series™.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain't_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch	"""There ain't no such thing as a free lunch"" (alternatively, ""There is no such thing as a free lunch"" or other variants) is a popular adage communicating the idea that it is impossible to get something for nothing. The acronyms TANSTAAFL and TINSTAAFL, and initialism TNSTAAFL, are also used. Uses of the phrase dating back to the 1930s and 1940s have been found, but the phrase's first appearance is unknown.[1] The ""free lunch"" in the saying refers to the nineteenth-century practice in American bars of offering a ""free lunch"" in order to entice drinking customers.

The phrase and the acronym are central to Robert Heinlein's 1966 science-fiction novel The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, which helped popularize it.[2][3] The free-market economist Milton Friedman also popularized the phrase[1] by using it as the title of a 1975 book,[4] and it is used in economics literature to describe opportunity cost.[5] Campbell McConnell writes that the idea is ""at the core of economics"".[6]

The ""free lunch"" refers to the once-common tradition of saloons in the United States providing a ""free"" lunch to patrons who had purchased at least one drink. Many foods on offer were high in salt (e.g., ham, cheese, and salted crackers), so those who ate them ended up buying a lot of beer. Rudyard Kipling, writing in 1891, noted how he

TANSTAAFL, on the other hand, indicates an acknowledgement that in reality a person or a society cannot get ""something for nothing"". Even if something appears to be free, there is always a cost to the person or to society as a whole, although that may be a hidden cost or an externality. For example, as Heinlein has one of his characters point out, a bar offering a free lunch will likely charge more for its drinks.[8]

According to Robert Caro, Fiorello La Guardia, on becoming mayor of New York in 1933, said ""È finita la cuccagna!"", meaning ""The abundance is finished"" or, more liberally translated, ""No more free lunch""; in this context ""free lunch"" refers to graft and corruption.[1] The earliest known occurrence of the full phrase (except for the ""a""), in the form ""There ain't no such thing as free lunch"", appears as the punchline of a joke related in an article in the El Paso Herald-Post of June 27, 1938 (and other Scripps-Howard newspapers about the same time), entitled ""Economics in Eight Words"".[9][10]

In 1945, ""There ain't no such thing as a free lunch"" appeared in the Columbia Law Review, and ""there is no free lunch"" appeared in a 1942 article in the Oelwein Daily Register (in a quote attributed to economist Harley L. Lutz) and in a 1947 column by economist Merryle S. Rukeyser.[2][11]

In 1949, the phrase appeared in an article by Walter Morrow in the San Francisco News (published on 1 June) and in Pierre Dos Utt's monograph TANSTAAFL: A Plan for a New Economic World Order,[12] which describes an oligarchic political system based on his conclusions from ""no free lunch"" principles.

The 1938 and 1949 sources use the phrase in relating a fable about a king (Nebuchadnezzar in Dos Utt's retelling) seeking advice from his economic advisors. Morrow's retelling, which claims to derive from an earlier editorial reported to be non-existent,[13] but closely follows the story as related in the earlier article in the El Paso Herald-Post, differs from Dos Utt's in that the ruler asks for ever-simplified advice following their original ""eighty-seven volumes of six hundred pages"" as opposed to a simple failure to agree on ""any major remedy"". The last surviving economist advises that ""There ain't no such thing as free lunch.""

In 1950, a New York Times columnist ascribed the phrase to economist (and army general) Leonard P. Ayres of the Cleveland Trust Company: ""It seems that shortly before the General's death [in 1946]... a group of reporters approached the general with the request that perhaps he might give them one of several immutable economic truisms that he had gathered from his long years of economic study... 'It is an immutable economic fact,' said the general, 'that there is no such thing as a free lunch.'""[14]

The September 8, 1961, issue of LIFE magazine has an editorial on page 4, ""'TANSTAFL,' It's the Truth,"" that closes with an anecdotal farmer explaining this slight variant of TANSTAAFL.

In 1966, author Robert A. Heinlein published his seminal work The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, in which TANSTaaFL was a central, libertarian theme, mentioned by name and explained. This brought its use and the idea into mainstream popularity.[2][3]

Edwin G. Dolan used the phrase as the title of his 1971 book TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch) – A Libertarian Perspective on Environmental Policy.[15]

The free-market economist Milton Friedman subsequently increased the popularity of the phrase[1] by using it as the title of a 1975 book,[4] and it is used in economics literature to describe opportunity cost.[5] Campbell McConnell writes that the idea is ""at the core of economics"".[6]

In the late 20th century, c. 1982–1992, Edmund Kanaan Maloof CPA, Accounting Professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, re-popularized the term TANSTAAFL in his advanced Accounting Topics Classes.

In economics, TANSTAAFL demonstrates opportunity cost. Greg Mankiw described the concept as follows: ""To get one thing that we like, we usually have to give up another thing that we like. Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another.""[16] The idea that there is no free lunch at the societal level applies only when all resources are being used completely and appropriately – i.e., when economic efficiency prevails. If not, a 'free lunch' can be had through a more efficient utilization of resources. Or, as Fred Brooks put it, ""You can only get something for nothing if you have previously gotten nothing for something."" If one individual or group gets something at no cost, somebody else ends up paying for it. If there appears to be no direct cost to any single individual, there is a social cost. Similarly, someone can benefit for ""free"" from an externality or from a public good, but someone has to pay the cost of producing these benefits. (See Free rider problem and Tragedy of the commons).

In the sciences, TANSTAAFL means that the universe as a whole is ultimately a closed system. There is no magic source of matter, energy, light, or indeed lunch, that does not draw resources from something else, and that will not eventually be exhausted. Therefore the TANSTAAFL argument may also be applied to natural physical processes in a closed system (either the universe as a whole, or any system that does not receive energy or matter from outside). (See Second law of thermodynamics.) The bio-ecologist Barry Commoner used this concept as the last of his famous ""Four Laws of Ecology"".

In mathematical finance, the term is also used as an informal synonym for the principle of no-arbitrage. This principle states that a combination of securities that has the same cash-flows as another security must have the same net price in equilibrium.

TANSTAAFL is sometimes used as a response to claims of the virtues of free software. Supporters of free software often counter that the use of the term ""free"" in this context is primarily a reference to a lack of constraint (""libre"") rather than a lack of cost (""gratis""). Richard Stallman has described it as ""'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer'"".

The prefix ""TANSTAA-"" (or ""TINSTAA-"") is used in numerous other contexts as well to denote some immutable property of the system being discussed. For example, ""TANSTAANFS"" is used by electrical engineering professors to stand for ""There Ain't No Such Thing As A Noise-Free System"".

Baseball Prospectus coined the abbreviation ""TINSTAAPP"", for ""There Is No Such Thing As A Pitching Prospect"",[17] as many young pitchers hurt their arms before they can be effective at a major league level.

Some exceptions from the ""no free lunch"" tenet have been put forward, such as the Sun and carbon dioxide.[18] It was argued in particular that metabolism evolved to take advantage of the free lunch provided by the Sun, which also triggers production of vital oxygen in plants.[18]"

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/07/02/what-you-know-about-july-4th-is-wrong/	"You learned in school about what happened in July 1776, and think you have a good handle on events surrounding American independence from Great Britain. Right?

Well, if you think that was the day that America’s independence was declared by the Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia, you are wrong.

And if you think that that was the day that members of the Congress signed the new Declaration of Independence, as depicted in a famous canvas painting by John Trumbull, (which now hangs in the Rotunda of the Capitol of the United States), you are wrong.

And if you think that Thomas Jefferson alone wrote the Declaration of Independence, or the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia was made to ring to announce independence, or that Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag at the request of George Washington, you are wrong, wrong and wrong. And if you never learned about George Washington’s own declaration, that’s another gap in your historical knowledge.

Here, adapted from George Mason University’s History News Network as well as from some other sources, including Joseph J. Ellis’s book titled “Revolutionary Summer: The Birth of American Independence,” here are some truths about July 4th that may be news to you. (Note: I’ve published some of this before for July 4th).

American independence from Great Britain was not decided on July 4th.

Actually, the Continental Congress voted on July 2, 1776 to declare independence. On the night of July 2nd, the Pennsylvania Evening Post published the statement: “This day the Continental Congress declared the United Colonies Free and Independent States.” John Adams thought July 2 was going to be the day future Americans celebrated, or so he said in a letter to his wife, Abigail Adams:

In fact, Ellis makes the case that that Adams “liked to claim that the resolution of May 15 was the real declaration of independence and that Jefferson’s more famous declaration six weeks later was a merely ceremonial afterthought.” The resolution of May 15, which was actually approved on May 12, was a formal call for the colonies to write new state constitutions that would “replace the colonial constitutions. On May 15, Adams added a preface that placed the resolution in the context of the historical march to independence.

George Washington issued his own important declaration on July 2nd, Ellis wrote, without knowing what was happening in Philadelphia. In his General Orders on that day, he wrote:

“The time is now at hand which must probably determine, Whether Americans are to be, Freeman, or Slaves; whether they are to have any property they can call their own; whether their Houses and Farms are eto be pillaged and destroyed, and they consigned to a State of Wretchedness from which no human efforts will probably deliver them. The fate of the unborn Millions will now depend, under God, on the conduct of this army…. Let us therefore animate and encourage each other, and show the whole world, that a Freeman contending for Liberty on his own ground is superior to any slavish mercenary on earth.”

So what happened on July 4th, 1776?

The Continental Congress approved the Declaration of Independence, which was mostly written by Thomas Jefferson but subject to edits by the other members of the five-man team appointed to come up with the document (Ben Franklin, Robert Livingston, John Adams and Roger Sherman) as well as the full Continental Congress. Franklin had first right of refusal to draft the document, and he took it; Adams also said he did not want to, so the job fell to Jefferson. He finished the first draft during the third week of June, Ellis wrote.

But Americans didn’t first celebrate independence until July 8, when Philadelphia threw a big party, including a parade and the firing of guns. The army under George Washington, then camped near New York City, heard the news July 9 and celebrated then. Georgia got the word August 10th. And the British in London found out on August 30th.

Though both Jefferson and Adams later claimed the signing ceremony took place on July 4th, David McCullough wrotes in his biography of John Adams:

In fact, most delegates signed the document on August 2nd, when a clean copy was finally produced by Timothy Matlack, assistant to the secretary of Congress; some waited even later to sign, and the names on the document were made public only in January 1777.

The Liberty Bell did not ring in American Independence, despite the famous story about how a boy with blond hair and blue eyes was posted next to Independence Hall to give a signal to an old man in the bell tower when independence was declared. The story was concocted in the middle of the 19th century by writer George Lippard in a book intended for children. The book was aptly titled, “Legends of the American Revolution.” There was no pretense that the story was genuine.

In fact, the bell was not even named in honor of American independence. It received the moniker in the early 19th century when abolitionists used it as a symbol of the antislavery movement. And the famous crack? The bell cracked because it was badly designed.

It is also true that Betsy Ross did not in fact sew the first American flag despite the story that George Washington himself asked her to. It is not known who actually sewed the first flag, but it was designed by Francis Hopkinson, a signer of the Declaration. Records show that in May 1780 he sent a bill to the Board of Admiralty for designing the “flag of the United States.” A small group of descendants works hard to keep his name alive.

You may have learned that John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on the Fourth of July. They did, but the well-known story isn’t all true.

On July 4, 1826, Adams, the second president, and Jefferson, the third president, both died, exactly 50 years after the adoption of Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence. The country took it as a sign of American divinity.

But there is no proof to the long-told story that Adams, dying, uttered, “Jefferson survives,” which was said to be especially poignant, as Jefferson had died just hours before without Adams knowing it. Mark that as just another story we wished so hard were true we convinced ourselves it is.

By the way, James Monroe, our fifth president, died on July 4, 1831. And Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president, was born on July 4, 1872."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade	"A decade is a period of 10 years. The word is derived (via French and Latin) from the Ancient Greek dekas which means ten. Other words for spans of years also come from Latin: biennium, triennium, quadrennium, quinquennium (5 years), lustrum (5 years), century (100 years), millennium (1000 years).

Although any period of 10 years is a decade,[1][2] a convenient and frequently referenced interval is based on the tens digit of a calendar year, as in using ""1960s"" to represent the decade from 1960 to 1969.[3][4] Often, for brevity, only the tens part is mentioned (60s or sixties), although this may leave it uncertain which century is meant. These references are frequently used to encapsulate popular culture or other widespread phenomena that dominated such a decade, as in The Great Depression of the 1930s.

Because the common calendar starts with year 1, its first full decade is the years 1 to 10, the second decade from 11 to 20, and so on.[5] So although the ""1960s"" comprises the years 1960 to 1969, the ""197th decade"" spans 1961 to 1970.

A decade may also refer to an arbitrary span of 10 years. For example, the statement ""during his last decade, Mozart explored chromatic harmony to a degree rare at the time"", merely refers to the last 10 years of Mozart's life without regard to which calendar years are encompassed.

For decades of the 20th century, the term 'decade' often conjures not just a set of ten years but a distinct era roughly approximating those ten years - for example, the sixties often refer to events that took place between c. 1964 and 1972 and conjure memories of the counterculture, flower power and other things going on at the time."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel	"Nickel is a chemical element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel shows a significant chemical activity that can be observed when nickel is powdered to maximize the exposed surface area on which reactions can occur, but larger pieces of the metal are slow to react with air at ambient conditions due to the formation of a protective oxide surface. Even then, nickel is reactive enough with oxygen that native nickel is rarely found on Earth's surface, being mostly confined to the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were protected from oxidation during their time in space. On Earth, such native nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of those elements' origin as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's inner core.[4]

The use of nickel (as a natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook its ore for a copper mineral. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), that personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper. An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite, which often contains 1-2% nickel. Nickel's other important ore minerals include garnierite, and pentlandite. Major production sites include the Sudbury region in Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, and Norilsk in Russia.

Because of nickel's slow rate of oxidation at room temperature, it is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, this has led to its use for plating metals such as iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 6% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant pure-nickel plating. Nickel-plated items are noted for provoking nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.

Nickel is one of four elements that are ferromagnetic around room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is chiefly valuable in the modern world for the alloys it forms; about 60% of world production is used in nickel-steels (particularly stainless steel). Other common alloys, as well as some new superalloys, make up most of the remainder of world nickel use, with chemical uses for nickel compounds consuming less than 3% of production.[5] As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation. Enzymes of some microorganisms and plants contain nickel as an active site, which makes the metal an essential nutrient for them.

Nickel is a silvery-white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish. It is one of only four elements that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is 355 °C (671 °F), meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature.[6] The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352 nm, giving an atomic radius of 0.124 nm. This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70 GPa. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.

The nickel atom has two electron configurations, [Ar] 3d8 4s2 and [Ar] 3d9 4s1, which are very close in energy – the symbol [Ar] refers to the argon-like core structure. There is some disagreement as to which should be considered the lowest energy configuration.[7] Chemistry textbooks quote the electron configuration of nickel as [Ar] 4s2 3d8,[8] or equivalently as [Ar] 3d8 4s2.[9] This configuration agrees with the Madelung energy ordering rule, which predicts that 4s is filled before 3d. It is supported by the experimental fact that the lowest energy state of the nickel atom is a 3d8 4s2 energy level, specifically the 3d8(3F) 4s23F, J = 4 level.[10]

However, each of these configurations in fact gives rise to a set of states of different energies.[10] The two sets of energies overlap, and the average energy of states having configuration [Ar] 3d9 4s1 is in fact lower than the average energy of states having configuration [Ar] 3d8 4s2. For this reason, the research literature on atomic calculations quotes the ground state configuration of nickel as [Ar] 3d9 4s1.[7]

Naturally occurring nickel is composed of five stable isotopes; 58

Ni, 60

Ni, 61

Ni, 62

Ni and 64

Ni with 58

Ni being the most abundant (68.077% natural abundance). 62

Ni has the highest nuclear binding energy of any nuclide. Its binding energy is greater than both 56

Fe, often incorrectly cited as the largest, and 58

Fe.[11] 18 radioisotopes have been characterised with the most stable being 59

Ni with a half-life of 76,000 years, 63

Ni with a half-life of 100.1 years, and 56

Ni with a half-life of 6.077 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 60 hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 30 seconds. This element also has one meta state.[12]

Nickel-56 is produced by the silicon burning process and later set free in large quantities during type Ia supernovae. The shape of the light curve of these supernovae at intermediate to late-times corresponds to the decay via electron capture of nickel-56 to cobalt-56 and ultimately to iron-56.[13] Nickel-59 is a long-lived cosmogenic radionuclide with a half-life of 76,000 years. 59

Ni has found many applications in isotope geology. 59

Ni has been used to date the terrestrial age of meteorites and to determine abundances of extraterrestrial dust in ice and sediment. Nickel-60 is the daughter product of the extinct radionuclide 60

Fe, which decays with a half-life of 2.6 million years. Because 60

Fe has such a long half-life, its persistence in materials in the solar system at high enough concentrations may have generated observable variations in the isotopic composition of 60

Ni. Therefore, the abundance of 60

Ni present in extraterrestrial material may provide insight into the origin of the solar system and its early history. Nickel-62 has the highest binding energy per nucleon of any isotope for any element (8.7946 MeV,nucleon).[14] Isotopes heavier than 62

Ni cannot be formed by nuclear fusion without losing energy. 48Ni, discovered in 1999, is the most proton-rich heavy element isotope known. With 28 protons and 20 neutrons 48Ni is ""double magic"" (like 208Pb) and therefore unusually stable.[12][15]

The isotopes of nickel range in atomic weight from 48 u (48

Ni) to 78 u (78

Ni). Nickel-78's half-life was recently measured at 110 milliseconds, and is believed an important isotope in supernova nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron.[16]

On Earth, nickel occurs most often in combination with sulfur and iron in pentlandite, with sulfur in millerite, with arsenic in the mineral nickeline, and with arsenic and sulfur in nickel galena.[17] Nickel is commonly found in iron meteorites as the alloys kamacite and taenite.

The bulk of the nickel mined comes from two types of ore deposits. The first are laterites, where the principal ore minerals are nickeliferous limonite: (Fe, Ni)O(OH) and garnierite (a hydrous nickel silicate): (Ni, Mg)

 3Si

 2O

 5(OH)

 4. The second are magmatic sulfide deposits, where the principal ore mineral is pentlandite: (Ni, Fe)

 9S

 8.

Australia and New Caledonia have the biggest estimate reserves (45% all together).[18]

In terms of World Resources, identified land-based resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons of nickel (about the double of known reserves). About 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits.[18]

Based on geophysical evidence, most of the nickel on Earth is postulated to be concentrated in the Earth's outer and inner cores. Kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel. For kamacite, the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90:10 to 95:5, although impurities (such as cobalt or carbon) may be present, while for taenite the nickel content is between 20% and 65%. Kamacite and taenite occur in nickel iron meteorites.[19]

The most common oxidation state of nickel is +2, but compounds of Ni0, Ni+, and Ni3+ are well known, as well as exotic oxidation states Ni2−, Ni1−, and Ni4+.[20]

Nickel tetracarbonyl (Ni(CO)

 4), discovered by Ludwig Mond,[21] is a volatile, highly toxic liquid at room temperature. On heating, the complex decomposes back to nickel and carbon monoxide:

This behavior is exploited in the Mond process for purifying nickel, as described above. The related nickel(0) complex bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) is a useful catalyst in organonickel chemistry due to the easily displaced cod ligands.

Nickel(I) complexes are uncommon, however one example is the tetrahedral complex NiBr(PPh ) . Many nickel(I) complexes feature Ni-Ni bonding, such as the dark red diamagnetic K

 4[Ni

 2(CN)

 6] prepared by reduction of K

 2[Ni

 2(CN)

 6] with sodium amalgam. This compound is oxidised in water, liberating H

 2.[22]

It is thought that the nickel(I) oxidation state is important to nickel-containing enzymes, such as [NiFe]-hydrogenase, which catalyzes the reversible reduction of protons to H

 2.[23]

Nickel(II) forms compounds with all common anions, i.e. the sulfide, sulfate, carbonate, hydroxide, carboxylates, and halides. Nickel(II) sulfate is produced in large quantities by dissolving nickel metal or oxides in sulfuric acid. It exists as both a hexa- and heptahydrates.[24] This compound is useful for electroplating nickel. Common salts of nickel, such as the chloride, nitrate, and sulfate, dissolve in water to give green solutions containing the metal aquo complex [Ni(H

 2O)

 6]2+

.

The four halides form nickel compounds. The structures of these solids feature octahedral Ni centres. Nickel(II) chloride is most common, and its behavior is illustrative of the other halides. Nickel(II) chloride is produced by dissolving nickel or its oxide in hydrochloric acid. It is usually encountered as the green hexahydrate, the formula of which is usually written NiCl •6H O. When dissolved in water, this salt forms the metal aquo complex [Ni(H

 2O)

 6]2+

. Dehydration of NiCl •6H O gives the yellow anhydrous NiCl

 2.

Some tetracoordinate nickel(II) complexes, e.g. bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel chloride, exist both in tetrahedral and square planar geometries. The tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic whereas the square planar complexes are diamagnetic. This equilibrium as well as the formation of octahedral complexes contrasts with the behavior of the divalent complexes of the heavier group 10 metals, palladium(II) and platinum(II), which tend to adopt only square-planar geometry.[20]

Nickelocene is known; it has an electron count of 20, making it relatively unstable.

Numerous Ni(III) compounds are known, with the first such examples being Nickel(III) trihalophosphines (Ni (PPh )X .[25] Further, Ni(III) forms simple salts with fluoride[26] or oxide ions. Ni(III) can be stabilized by σ-donor ligands such as thiols and phosphines.[22] Ni(IV) is present in the mixed oxide BaNiO

 3, while Ni(III) is present in nickel(III) oxide, which is used as the cathode in many rechargeable batteries, including nickel-cadmium, nickel-iron, nickel hydrogen, and nickel-metal hydride, and used by certain manufacturers in Li-ion batteries.[27] Ni(IV) remains a rare oxidation state of Nickel and very few compounds are known to date.[28][29]

Because the ores of nickel are easily mistaken for ores of silver, understanding of this metal and its use dates to relatively recent times. However, the unintentional use of nickel is ancient, and can be traced back as far as 3500 BCE. Bronzes from what is now Syria have been found to contain up to 2% nickel.[30] Further, there are Chinese manuscripts suggesting that ""white copper"" (cupronickel, known as baitong) was used there between 1700 and 1400 BCE. This Paktong white copper was exported to Britain as early as the 17th century, but the nickel content of this alloy was not discovered until 1822.[31]

In medieval Germany, a red mineral was found in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) that resembled copper ore. However, when miners were unable to extract any copper from it, they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), for besetting the copper. They called this ore Kupfernickel from the German Kupfer for copper.[32][33][34][35] This ore is now known to be nickeline (aka niccolite), a nickel arsenide. In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt was trying to extract copper from kupfernickel at a cobalt mine in the Swedish village of Los, and instead produced a white metal that he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral, nickel.[36] In modern German, Kupfernickel or Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy cupronickel.

After its discovery, the only source for nickel was the rare Kupfernickel but, from 1824 on, nickel was obtained as a byproduct of cobalt blue production. The first large-scale producer of nickel was Norway, which exploited nickel-rich pyrrhotite from 1848 on. The introduction of nickel in steel production in 1889 increased the demand for nickel, and the nickel deposits of New Caledonia, which were discovered in 1865, provided most of the world's supply between 1875 and 1915. The discovery of the large deposits in the Sudbury Basin, Canada, in 1883, in Norilsk-Talnakh, Russia, in 1920, and in the Merensky Reef, South Africa, in 1924 made large-scale production of nickel possible.[31]

Nickel has been a component of coins since the mid-19th century. However, in Birmingham there were already Dutch silver 18th century coins forged in nickel around 1833 (meant for trading in Malaya).[37] In the United States, the term ""nickel"" or ""nick"" originally applied to the copper-nickel Flying Eagle cent, which replaced copper with 12% nickel 1857–58, then the Indian Head cent of the same alloy from 1859–1864. Still later, in 1865, the term designated the three-cent nickel, with nickel increased to 25%. In 1866, the five-cent shield nickel (25% nickel, 75% copper) appropriated the designation. Along with the alloy proportion, this term has been used to the present in the United States. Coins of nearly pure nickel were first used in 1881 in Switzerland, and more notably 99.9% nickel five-cent coins were struck in Canada (the world's largest nickel producer at the time) during non-war years from 1922–1981, and their metal content made these coins magnetic.[38] During the wartime period 1942–45, most or all nickel was removed from Canadian and U.S. coins, due to nickel's war-critical use in armor.[33][39] Canada used 99.9% nickel from 1968 in its higher-value coins until 2000. In the 21st century, the high price of nickel has led to some replacement of the metal in coins around the world. Coins still made with nickel alloys include one- and two- Euro coins, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ U.S. coins and 20p, 50p, £1 and £2 UK coins. The replacement of nickel-alloy 5p and 10p UK coins with nickel-plated steel models, begun in 2012, has caused dermatological controversy.[40]

The Philippines, Indonesia, Russia, Canada and Australia are the world's largest producers of nickel, as reported by the US Geological Survey.[18] The largest deposits of nickel in non-Russian Europe are located in Finland and Greece. Identified land-based resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons of nickel. About 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits. In addition, extensive deep-sea resources of nickel are in manganese crusts and nodules covering large areas of the ocean floor, particularly in the Pacific Ocean.[42]

The one locality in the United States where nickel was commercially mined is Riddle, Oregon, where several square miles of nickel-bearing garnierite surface deposits are located. The mine closed in 1987.[43][44] The Eagle mine project is a new nickel mine in Michigan's upper peninsula. Completed in 2013, it is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2014.[45]

Nickel is recovered through extractive metallurgy: it is extracted from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75% purity. In many stainless steel applications, 75% pure nickel can be used without further purification, depending on the composition of the impurities.

Most sulfide ores have traditionally been processed using pyrometallurgical techniques to produce a matte for further refining. Recent advances in hydrometallurgical techniques have resulted in significant nickel purification using these processes. Most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a froth flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction. In hydrometallurgical processes, nickel sulfide ores undergo flotation (differential flotation if Ni,Fe ratio is too low) and then smelted. After producing the nickel matte, further processing is done via the Sherritt-Gordon process. First, copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide, leaving a concentrate of only cobalt and nickel. Then, solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel, with the final nickel concentration greater than 99%.

A second common form of further refining involves the leaching of the metal matte into a nickel salt solution, followed by the electro-winning of the nickel from solution by plating it onto a cathode as electrolytic nickel.

Purification of nickel oxides to obtain the purest metal is performed via the Mond process, which increases the nickel concentrate to greater than 99.99% purity.[46] This process was patented by Ludwig Mond and has been in industrial use since before the beginning of the 20th century. In the process, nickel is reacted with carbon monoxide at around 40–80 °C to form nickel carbonyl in the presence of a sulfur catalyst. Iron gives iron pentacarbonyl, too, but this reaction is slow. If necessary, the nickel may be separated by distillation. Dicobalt octacarbonyl is also formed in nickel distillation as a by-product, but it decomposes to tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a non-volatile solid.[5]

Nickel is re-obtained from the nickel carbonyl by one of two processes. It may be passed through a large chamber at high temperatures in which tens of thousands of nickel spheres, called pellets, are constantly stirred. It then decomposes, depositing pure nickel onto the nickel spheres. Alternatively, the nickel carbonyl may be decomposed in a smaller chamber at 230 °C to create a fine nickel powder. The resultant carbon monoxide is re-circulated and reused through the process. The highly pure nickel produced by this process is known as ""carbonyl nickel"".[47]

The market price of nickel surged throughout 2006 and the early months of 2007; as of April 5, 2007, the metal was trading at US$52,300,tonne or $1.47,oz.[48] The price subsequently fell dramatically from these peaks, and as of September 19, 2013 the metal was trading at $13,778,tonne, or $0.39,oz.[49][50]

The US nickel coin contains 0.04 ounces (1.1 g) of nickel, which at the April 2007 price was worth 6.5 cents, along with 3.75 grams of copper worth about 3 cents, making the metal value over 9 cents. Since the face value of a nickel is 5 cents, this made it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals at a profit. However, the United States Mint, in anticipation of this practice, implemented new interim rules on December 14, 2006, subject to public comment for 30 days, which criminalized the melting and export of cents and nickels.[51] Violators can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000 and,or imprisoned for a maximum of five years.

As of September 19, 2013, the melt value of a U.S. nickel (copper and nickel included) is $0.0450258, which is 90% of its face value.[52]

The fraction of global nickel production presently used for various applications is as follows: 46% for making nickel steels; 34% in nonferrous alloys and superalloys; 14% electroplating, and 6% into other uses.[18][53]

Nickel is used in many specific and recognizable industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel, alnico magnets, coinage, rechargeable batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules, and special alloys. It is also used for plating and as a green tint in glass. Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in the nickel steels and nickel cast irons, of which there are many varieties. It is also widely used in many other alloys, such as nickel brasses and bronzes, and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold (Inconel, Incoloy, Monel, Nimonic).[54]

Because of its resistance to corrosion, nickel has been occasionally used historically as a substitute for decorative silver. Nickel was also occasionally used in some countries after 1859 as a cheap coinage metal (see above) but in the later years of the 20th century was largely replaced by cheaper stainless steel (i.e., iron) alloys, except notably in the United States and Canada.

Nickel is an excellent alloying agent for certain other precious metals, and so used in the so-called fire assay, as a collector of platinum group elements (PGE). As such, nickel is capable of full collection of all 6 PGE elements from ores, in addition to partial collection of gold. High-throughput nickel mines may also engage in PGE recovery (primarily platinum and palladium); examples are Norilsk in Russia and the Sudbury Basin in Canada.

Nickel foam or nickel mesh is used in gas diffusion electrodes for alkaline fuel cells.[55][56]

Nickel and its alloys are frequently used as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. Raney nickel, a finely divided nickel-aluminium alloy, is one common form, however related catalysts are also often used, including related 'Raney-type' catalysts.

Nickel is a naturally magnetostrictive material, meaning that, in the presence of a magnetic field, the material undergoes a small change in length.[57][58] In the case of nickel, this change in length is negative (contraction of the material), which is known as negative magnetostriction and is on the order of 50 ppm.

Nickel is used as a binder in the cemented tungsten carbide or hardmetal industry and used in proportions of six to 12% by weight. Nickel can make the tungsten carbide magnetic and adds corrosion-resistant properties to the cemented tungsten carbide parts, although the hardness is lower than those of parts made with cobalt binder.[59]

Although not recognized until the 1970s, nickel plays important roles in the biology of microorganisms and plants.[60][61] The plant enzyme urease (an enzyme that assists in the hydrolysis of urea) contains nickel. The NiFe-hydrogenases contain nickel in addition to iron-sulfur clusters. Such [NiFe]-hydrogenases characteristically oxidise H

 2. A nickel-tetrapyrrole coenzyme, Cofactor F430, is present in the methyl coenzyme M reductase, which powers methanogenic archaea.[62] One of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes consists of an Fe-Ni-S cluster.[63] Other nickel-containing enzymes include a rare bacterial class of superoxide dismutase[64] and glyoxalase I enzymes in bacteria and several parasitic eukaryotic trypanosomal parasites [65] (this enzyme in higher organisms, including yeast and mammals, uses divalent zinc, Zn2+).[66][67][68][69][70]

Nickel can have an impact on human health through infectious diseases arising from nickel-dependent bacteria.[71] Nickel released from Siberian Traps volcanic eruptions (site of the modern city of Norilsk) is suspected of having had a significant impact on the role played by Methanosarcina, a genus of euryarchaeote archaea that produced methane during the biggest extinction event on record.[72]

In the US, the minimal risk level of nickel and its compounds is set to 0.2 µg,m3 for inhalation during 15–364 days.[73] Nickel sulfide fume and dust are believed carcinogenic, and various other nickel compounds may be as well.[74][75][76]Nickel carbonyl, [Ni(CO)

 4], is an extremely toxic gas. The toxicity of metal carbonyls is a function of both the toxicity of the metal as well as the carbonyl's ability to give off highly toxic carbon monoxide gas, and this one is no exception; nickel carbonyl is also explosive in air.[77][78]

In the US, the Tolerable Upper Limit of dietary nickel is 1000 µg,day,[79] while estimated average ingestion is 69-162 µg,day.[80] Large amounts of nickel (and chromium) – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88 µg.[81][82]

Sensitized individuals may show an allergy to nickel, affecting their skin, known as dermatitis. Sensitivity to nickel may also be present in patients with pompholyx. Nickel is an important cause of contact allergy, partly due to its use in jewellery intended for pierced ears.[83] Nickel allergies affecting pierced ears are often marked by itchy, red skin. Many earrings are now made nickel-free due to this problem. The amount of nickel allowed in products that come into contact with human skin is regulated by the European Union. In 2002, researchers found amounts of nickel being emitted by 1 and 2 Euro coins far in excess of those standards. This is believed to be due to a galvanic reaction.[84] Nickel was voted Allergen of the Year in 2008 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society.[85]

Reports also showed that both the nickel-induced activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) and the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes are due to depleted intracellular ascorbate levels. The addition of ascorbate to the culture medium increased the intracellular ascorbate level and reversed both the metal-induced stabilization of HIF-1- and HIF-1α-dependent gene expression.[86][87]"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(United_States_coin)	"The United States one-cent coin, commonly known as a penny, is a unit of currency equaling one-hundredth of a United States dollar. The cent's symbol is ¢. Its obverse has featured the profile of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909, the centennial of his birth. From 1959 (the sesquicentennial of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial. Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincoln's 200th birthday and a new, ""permanent"" reverse – the Union Shield – was introduced in 2010. The coin is 0.75 inches (19.05 mm) in diameter and 0.0598 inches (1.52 mm) in thickness.

The U.S. Mint's official name for a penny is ""cent""[2] and the U.S. Treasury's official name is ""one cent piece"".[3] The colloquial term penny derives from the British coin of the same name, the pre-decimal version of which had a similar value. In American English, pennies is the plural form. (The plural form pence—standard in British English—is not used in American English.)

As of 2015, based on the U.S. Mint Annual Report released for 2014, it costs the U.S. Mint 1.67 cents (down from 2.41 cents in 2011 and 1.83 cents in 2013) to make one cent because of the cost of materials, production, and distribution.[4] This figure includes the Mint’s fixed components for distribution and fabrication, as well as Mint overhead allocated to the penny. Fixed costs and overhead would have to be absorbed by other circulating coins without the penny.[5] The loss in profitability due to producing the one cent coin in the United States for the year of 2013 was $55,000,000. This was a slight decrease from 2012, the year before, which had a production loss of $58,000,000.

In honor of the Lincoln cent's 100th anniversary, special 2009 cents were minted for collectors in the same composition as the 1909 coins.[9]

The isotope composition of early coins spanning the period of 1828 to 1843 cents reflects that of copper from Cornwall ores from England while coins after 1850 that from the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan ores, a finding consistent with historical records.[10]

In 1943, at the peak of World War II, zinc-coated steel cents were made for a short time because of war demands for copper. A few copper cents from 1943 were produced from the 1942 planchets remaining in the bins. Similarly, some 1944 steel cents have been confirmed. From 1944 through 1946, salvaged ammunition shells made their way into the minting process, and it was not uncommon to see coins featuring streaks of brass or having a considerably darker finish than other issues.

During the early 1970s, the price of copper rose to a point where the cent contained almost one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternative metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and over 1.5 million of these pennies were struck and ready for public release before ultimately being rejected. The proposed aluminum pennies were rejected for two reasons: vending machine owners complained the coins would cause mechanical problems; and pediatricians and pediatric radiologists pointed out that the radiodensity of the metal inside the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was close to that of soft tissue, and the coins would therefore be difficult to detect in X-ray imaging.[11] One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.

The cent's composition was changed in 1982 because the value of the copper in the coin started to rise above one cent.[12] This was mainly caused by inflation. Some 1982 pennies used the 97.5% zinc composition, while others used the 95% copper composition. With the exception of 2009 bicentennial cents minted specifically for collectors, United States cents minted after 1982 have been copper-plated zinc. In Fiscal Year 2013, the average one-cent piece minted cost the U.S. Mint 1.83 cents, down from 2.41 cents apiece in FY 2011.[13]

Distinguishing between the bronze and copper cents and the newer, zinc cents can be done by dropping the coin on a solid surface. The predominantly copper coins produce a higher-pitched ringing sound, while the zinc coins make a lower-pitched ""clunk"".[14] In addition, a full 50-cent roll of pre-1982,3 coins weighs 5.4 oz compared to a post-1982–83 roll which weighs 4.4 oz.

Mintage figures for the Lincoln cent can be found at Lincoln cent mintage figures.

The coin has gone through several designs over its two-hundred-year time frame. Until 1857 it was about the size of the current U.S. dollar coins (Susan B. Anthony through present dollars).

The following types of cents have been produced:

Throughout its history, the Lincoln cent has featured several typefaces for the date, but most of the digits have been old-style numerals, except with the 4 and 8 neither ascending nor descending. The only significant divergence is that the 3 was non-descending (the same size as a 0, 1, or 2) in the early history, before switching to descending for one year in 1934 and then permanently (as of 2014 ) in 1943.

From 1959 until 2008, the Lincoln Memorial was shown on the reverse of the United States cent. Because the Lincoln Memorial was shown in sufficient detail to discern the statue of Lincoln on the reverse of cent, Abraham Lincoln was at that time the only person to be depicted on both the obverse and reverse of the same United States coin. In 1999, the New Jersey state quarter was released, which depicts George Washington on both sides, crossing the Delaware River on the reverse side and in profile on the obverse. (The state quarter for South Dakota, released in 2006, also features Washington on both sides: the typical profile on the obverse, and Washington within Mount Rushmore on the reverse.) Some of the 2009 reverse design series no longer showed Abraham Lincoln, and the 2010 Lincoln Union Shield has removed the president from the coin reverse for the foreseeable future.

An additional design detail that is not readily visible to the naked eye is found on the obverse side of the 1918 onward United States cent. The letters “VDB” stamped on the bottom sleeve of Abraham Lincoln represent the initials of Victor David Brenner, the primary designer of the Wheat cent.

The Lincoln cent is the current one cent coin of the U.S. It was adopted in 1909, replacing the Indian Head cent. Its reverse was changed in 1959 from a wheat stalks design to a design which includes the Lincoln Memorial (to commemorate Lincoln's sesquicentennial) and was replaced again in 2009 with four new designs to commemorate Lincoln's bicentennial. There are more one-cent coins produced than any other denomination, which makes the Lincoln cent a familiar item. In its lifespan, this coin has weathered both world wars, one of which temporarily changed its composition as part of the war effort. The obverse is the longest design used for any circulating American currency.

When the Lincoln one-cent coin made its initial appearance in 1909, it marked a radical departure from the accepted styling of United States coinage, as it was the first regular coin to bear a portrait other than the mythical Liberty, which appeared on most pre-1909 regular coins. (Even the so-called Indian Head of the Indian Head cent it replaced depicted Liberty as a Native American. The Sacagawea dollar depicts a historical person, and is the first U.S. circulation coin to honor a specific Native person, although there are no known portraits of Sacagawea. The Indian Head nickel depicts an idealized Indian chief rather than a specific person.) Previously, a strong feeling had prevailed against using portraits on coins in the United States, but public sentiment stemming from the 100th anniversary celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birth proved stronger than the long-standing tradition.

A variety of privately minted tokens bearing Lincoln's image circulated as one-cent pieces during Lincoln's presidency; legitimate coinage had become scarce during the Civil War. These early tokens undoubtedly influenced the denomination, appearance, size, and composition of Lincoln cents.

Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th U.S. President, thought American coins were so common and uninspiring that he attempted to get the motto ""In God We Trust"" removed as offending religion. Roosevelt had the opportunity to pose for a young Lithuanian-born Jew, Victor David Brenner, who, since arriving nineteen years earlier in the United States had become one of the nation’s premier medalists. Roosevelt had learned of Brenner's talents in a settlement house on New York City's Lower East Side and was immediately impressed with a bas-relief that Brenner had made of Lincoln, based on a Mathew Brady photograph. Roosevelt, who considered Lincoln the savior of the Union and the greatest Republican President and who also considered himself Lincoln’s political heir, ordered the new Lincoln cent to be based on Brenner's work and that it go just in time to commemorate Lincoln’s 100th birthday in 1909. The likeness of President Lincoln on the obverse of the coin is an adaptation of a plaque Brenner executed several years earlier and which had come to the attention of President Roosevelt in New York.[16]

In addition to the prescribed elements on U.S. coins – LIBERTY and the date – the motto In God We Trust appeared for the first time on a coin of this denomination. The United States Congress passed the Act of March 3, 1865, authorizing the use of this motto on U.S. coins[citation needed], during Lincoln's tenure in office.

Even though no legislation was required for the new design, approval of the Secretary of the Treasury was necessary to make the change. Franklin MacVeagh gave his approval on July 14, 1909, and not quite three weeks later, on August 2, the new coin was released to the public.

In 1918, after the controversy over Brenner's name and initials on the reverse had died down, his initials were placed on the obverse with no further controversy. They are to be found in minute form on the rim of the bust, just under the shoulder of Lincoln.

In 1969, the design was revised to make Lincoln look more like Brenner's original sculptures.

A study of three potential reverses resulted in the approval of a very simple design bearing two wheatheads in memorial style. Between these, in the center of the coin, are the denomination and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, while curving around the upper border is the national motto, E Pluribus Unum, Latin for ""From Many, One.""

The original model bore Brenner's name on the reverse, curving along the rim below UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Before the coins were issued, however, the initials ""VDB"" were substituted because officials at the United States Mint felt the name was too prominent. After the coin was released, many protested that even the initials were conspicuous and detracted from the design. Because the coin was in great demand, and because to make a change would have required halting production, the decision was made to eliminate the initials entirely.

Thus in 1909 the U.S. had six different cents: the 1909 and 1909-S Indian Head cents, and four Lincoln coins: 1909 VDB, 1909-S VDB, 1909 and 1909-S. In all cases the Philadelphia mintages far exceeded the San Francisco issues. While the smallest mintage is the '09-S Indian, the '09-S VDB is the key Lincoln date, and hence is most valuable. Its mintage of 484,000 is only 1.7% of the plain V.D.B.

On February 12, 1959, a revised reverse design was introduced as part of the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's birth. No formal competition was held. Frank Gasparro, then Assistant Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint, prepared the winning entry, selected from a group of 23 models that the engraving staff at the Mint had been asked to present for consideration. Again, only the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury was necessary to make the change because the design had been in use for more than the required 25 years. The imposing marble Lincoln Memorial provides the central motif, with the legends E Pluribus Unum and UNITED STATES oF AMERICA completing the design, together with the denomination. The initials ""FG"" appear on the right, near the shrubbery.

The Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 required that the cent's reverse be redesigned in 2009. This resulted in the mintage of four different coins showing scenes from Abraham Lincoln's life in honor of the bicentennial of his birth.

These four designs, unveiled September 22, 2008 at a ceremony held at the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., are:

Special 2009 cents struck for sale in sets to collectors had the metallic copper content of cents minted in 1909 (95% copper, 5% tin and zinc). Those struck for circulation retained the normal composition of a zinc core coated with copper.

The 2005 act that authorized the redesign for the Bicentennial stated that another redesigned reverse for the Lincoln cent will be minted which ""shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln's preservation of the United States of America as a single and united country"".[19] Eighteen designs were proposed for the reverse of the 2010 cent.[20] On April 16, 2009 the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) met and selected a design that showed 13 wheat sheaves bound together with a ring symbolizing American unity as one nation.[21] Later this design was withdrawn because it was similar to coinage issued in Germany in the 1920s.[22] The Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee later met and chose a design showing a Union shield with superimposed in a scroll; E Pluribus Unum was also depicted in the upper portion of the shield.[22] In June 2009 the CFA met again and chose a design featuring a modern rendition of the American flag.[22] As a part of the release ceremony for the last of the 2009 cents on November 12, the design for the 2010 cent was announced.[23] The design chosen was the one that was chosen earlier by the CCAC.[23] According to the Mint, the 13 stripes on the shield ""represent the states joined in one compact union to support the Federal government, represented by the horizontal bar above.""[24] The Mint also noted that a shield was commonly used in paintings in the Capitol hallways painted by Constantino Brumidi, an artist in the Capitol active during the Lincoln Presidency.[24] The obverse of the cent was also changed to a modern rendition of Brenner's design.[1][23] The new Union Shield design replaces the Lincoln memorial in use since 1959.[23] The coin was designed by artist Lyndall Bass and sculpted by U.S. Mint sculptor-engraver Joseph Menna.[25] In January 2010, the coins were released early in Puerto Rico;[26] this was caused by a shortage of 2009-dated pennies on the island.[1] The new design was released at a ceremony at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois on February 11, 2010.[27]

Bronze cents, 1908–1942. Initially the alloy of the Lincoln cent followed that established for this denomination with the Indian Head design in 1864, 95% copper and 5% tin and zinc.

Zinc-plated steel cents, 1943. The composition of the Lincoln cent was changed in 1943.

Production of the war-time cent was provided for in an Act of Congress approved on December 18, 1942, which also set as the expiration date of the authority December 31, 1946. Low-grade carbon steel formed the base of these coins, to which a zinc coating 0.005-inch (0.13 mm) thick was deposited on each side electrolytically as a rust preventive. This coating was applied to the steel before the blanks were made, leaving the rims of these coins extremely susceptible to rust. The same size was maintained, but the weight was reduced from the standard 48 grains (3.1 g) to 42 grains (2.7 g), by using a lighter alloy. Production commenced on February 27, 1943, and by December 31 of that year, the three Mint facilities had produced 1,093,838,670 of the one-cent coins. The copper released for the war effort was enough to meet the combined needs of two cruisers, two destroyers, 1,243 Flying Fortresses, 120 field guns and 120 howitzers, or enough for 1,250,000 shells for large field guns.[28][29]

Shell-casing brass cents, 1944–1946. Numerous complaints about the gray color of the 1943 cents, especially that they could be mistaken for dimes, led to a change in composition. On January 1, 1944, the Mint was able to adopt a modified alloy, the supply being derived from expended shell casings which, when melted, furnished a composition similar to the original, but with a much smaller trace of tin.[citation needed] The original weight of 48 grains (3.1 g) was also restored.

Bronze, 1946–1962. Shell casings were no longer used after 1946 and the original copper-tin-zinc ""bronze"" composition was again used.

Brass cents, 1962–1982. The composition of the coin was changed again in 1962. Mint officials felt that deletion of the tin content would have no adverse effect on the wearing qualities of the coin, whereas the manufacturing advantages to be gained with the alloy stabilized at 95% copper and 5% zinc would be of much benefit. Congressional authority for this modification is contained in an Act of Congress approved on September 5, 1962.

Experimental aluminum cents, 1974. During the early 1970s, the price of copper rose to a point where the cent almost contained one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternate metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and in 1973, a total of 1,579,324 such coins were struck (dated 1974) and ready for public release. A few were distributed to members of the U.S. Congress, but aluminum was ultimately rejected for a variety of reasons. About a dozen aluminum cents are believed to still be in the hands of collectors, although they are now considered illegal to own.[30] One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution. Another is in the hands of the family of a deceased U.S. Capitol police officer, known as the Toven Specimen, and was certified as authentic in 2005.[31]

Copper-plated zinc, 1982–present. In mid-1982, the coin's composition was changed again, this time to copper-plated zinc. The last mostly-copper cents (95% copper metal composition) were produced by the Denver Mint on October 22, 1982. The copper-plated zinc cent coins are still being produced today. They are composed of an inner core alloy of 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper with an outer plating of pure copper, for an overall composition of 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper, and are minted on blanks produced for the Mint by an outside manufacturer (Jarden Zinc Products). Except for the new lighter total coin weight of 2.5 grams each, these newer coins are identical in diameter and thickness, and nearly in appearance, to the mostly copper (95%) cents issued before mid-1982, which weighed 3.11 grams each. A few pennies were struck by error in brass dated 1983 and are extremely rare.[32]

When the Lincoln Cent was introduced in 1909, it was discovered that the coining dies and their curved fields were unable to be polished to proof coining condition by existing Mint equipment. To produce Proof coinage for collectors, the U.S. Mint adopted the French technique of the Matte Proof, which was thought to highlight the design, while leaving the details of the coin as the designer intended. This was done by a sandblasting of the dies prior to use. When struck by the high pressure hydraulic press of the Philadelphia Mint Medal Room, the result was a semi-rough surface, a gentle luster and strongly defined wide square rims. These coins were produced in very small numbers, and the dies quickly developed small marks, known as diagnostics. These marks are used today by Third Party Graders and Collectors to authenticate the coin. Sold for mere pennies over face during the years of production, they were not popular with collectors. When new, the coins were wrapped in a tarnish-proof tissue, which over time proved to be anything but. Since many of these coins sat for decades unsold, vivid colors and toning developed. It is not unusual to see vivid blues, greens, lavender, coppery orange, deep reds and purple hues on these coins. Eagerly collected by numismatists today, they are among the most valuable Lincoln cents. Unencapsulated coins are easily identified by wide, square outer rims, quite unlike the rounded edges of business strikes.

Through mint errors, a number of rare and valuable Lincoln Cents have been produced. Some random errors, such as an off-center strike, slightly increase the value of the coin, and are sought after by niche collectors. However some errors were systemic, and produced a number of coins with exactly the same problem in the same year. These have become recognized varieties that are often extremely valuable and sought after by mainstream collectors.

The first Doubled Die error occurred during the production of the 1909 VDB. Not identified until the 1970s, it shows the RTY in Liberty and the 190 of the date slightly doubled. This coin is extremely rare in high grades.

In 1922, no one-cent coins were produced by the Philadelphia Mint. However, three pairs of Denver Mint worn and overly polished dies then produced the Weak D and No D varieties, making them appear as if they had been produced in Philadelphia. These varieties are known as the 1922 plain cents. Collectors must be wary of removed mint marks.

There are a few 1943 cents that were produced in bronze, as opposed to the steel,zinc composition used that year. There are 10 to 12 known to exist.[33] Likewise, a few 1944 cents were produced in steel,zinc.

In 1955, a hubbing error caused some cents to get struck with an obverse die which showed doubling in all of the obverse devices, producing a prominent doubling of the date, and to a less noticeable degree, the rest of the obverse. This is known as the 1955 doubled die cent. A similar die error occurred in 1969 on dies used at the San Francisco Mint. While the 1955 doubled die cent is well-known and widely collected, the 1969-S doubled die is far rarer, with an uncirculated specimen selling for as much as $126,500 in a 2008 Heritage auction.[34] A slightly different mechanism produced 1972, 1983, 1984, and 1995 Doubled die cents. Doubled Dies are known in practically every date in the Lincoln cent series, but most are minor, and less impressive compared to the 1955 and the other Doubled Die varieties mentioned here.

In 1990, 3,055 proof cents were struck at the San Francisco Mint without the ""S"" mint mark, making them appear as if they had been struck at the Philadelphia Mint. However, as no proof cents were struck in Philadelphia that year, they are easily distinguishable as errors, and highly valuable.

The reverse of some Lincoln cents minted in 1992 at the Philadelphia and Denver mints and some of those minted in 1998 and 1999 at the San Francisco mint feature a smaller-than-normal gap between the first two letters of AMERICA. These coins, known as the Close AM variety are valued at $20,000 and $5,000 for the 1992 specimens in gem uncirculated condition and $3,000 and $1,000 for the San Francisco specimens in gem proof condition.

The reverse of some Lincoln cents minted in 1998, 1999, and 2000 in Philadelphia feature a larger-than-normal gap between the first two letters of AMERICA. These coins, known as the Wide AM variety are valued at $10, $500, and $5, respectively, in gem uncirculated condition.

Zinc, a major component of mid-1982-and-later U.S. cents, is toxic in large quantities. Swallowing such a coin, which is 97.5% zinc, can cause damage to the stomach lining because of the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.[35] Coins are the most commonly ingested foreign body in children but generally are allowed to pass spontaneously unless the patient is symptomatic.[36] Zinc toxicity, mostly in the form of the ingestion of U.S. pennies minted after 1982, is commonly fatal in dogs where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia.[37] It is also highly toxic in pet parrots and can often be fatal.[38]

It has been suggested that the cent should be eliminated as a unit of currency for several reasons including that many Americans do not actually spend them, but rather only receive them in change at stores and proceed to return them to a bank for higher denomination currencies, or cash them in at coin counting kiosks. Most modern vending machines do not accept pennies, further diminishing their utility, and the production cost (figured in U.S. Dollars) now exceeds the face value of the coin, caused by increasing inflation.[39] In 2001 and 2006, for example, United States Representative Jim Kolbe (R) of Arizona introduced bills which would have stopped production of pennies (in 2001, the Legal Tender Modernization Act, and in 2006, the Currency Overhaul for an Industrious Nation [COIN] Act).[40]

In anticipation of the business of melting down U.S. pennies and U.S. nickels for profit, the U.S. Mint, which is a part of the US Department of the Treasury, implemented new regulations[41] on December 14, 2006, which criminalize the melting of pennies and nickels and place limits on export of the coins. Violators can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000 USD and,or imprisoned for a maximum of five years.[42]

The U.S. Mint reported that in fiscal year 2010 the unit cost of producing and shipping one-cent coins was 1.79 cents, which is more than the face value of the coin.[43] After reaching a peak cost of 2.41 cents in 2011 due to the significant rise in global metal demand and prices, recently the cost has declined to 1.83 cents for 2013. In the 2014 fiscal year, the cost to produce a penny declined even further to 1.70 cents.[44]

When copper reached a record high in February 2011,[45] the melt value of a 95% copper penny was more than three times its face value. As of January 21, 2014, a pre-1982 penny contained 2.20325 cents' worth of copper and zinc, making it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals for profit. In comparison, post-1982 copper-plated zinc cents have a metallurgical value of only 0.55152 cents.[46]

The Secretary of the Treasury has authority to alter the percentage of copper and zinc in the one-cent coin if needed due to cost fluctuations.[43]"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar	"The United States dollar (sign: $; code: USD; also abbreviated US$ and referred to as the dollar, U.S. dollar, US dollar or American dollar) is the official currency of the United States and its overseas territories. It is a Federal Reserve Note and consists of 100 smaller cent units.

The U.S. dollar is fiat money. It is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's most dominant reserve currency.[8] Several countries use it as their official currency, and in many others it is the de facto currency.[9] Besides the United States, it is also used as the sole currency in two British Overseas Territories in the Caribbean: the British Virgin Islands and the Turks and Caicos islands. A few countries use only the US Dollar for paper money, while the country mints its own coins, or also accepts US coins that can be use as payment in US dollars, such as the Susan B. Anthony dollar. Some cities around the world use the U.S. dollar as the de facto currency alongside their own. Some countries and territories who pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar seen the value of their currency rise, and now some currencies are at par with the U.S. dollar. While others have seen their currency maintain a higher value against the U.S. dollar.

The Constitution of the United States of America provides that the United States Congress has the power ""To coin money"".[10] Laws implementing this power are currently codified in Section 5112 of Title 31 of the United States Code. Section 5112 prescribes the forms, in which the United States dollars should be issued.[11] These coins are both designated in Section 5112 as ""legal tender"" in payment of debts.[11] The Sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy dollar. The pure silver dollar is known as the American Silver Eagle. Section 5112 also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins, which have values ranging from one cent to 50 dollars.[11] These other coins are more fully described in Coins of the United States dollar.

The Constitution provides that ""a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time"".[12] That provision of the Constitution is made specific by Section 331 of Title 31 of the United States Code.[13] The sums of money reported in the ""Statements"" are currently being expressed in U.S. dollars (for example, see the 2009 Financial Report of the United States Government).[14] The U.S. dollar may therefore be described as the unit of account of the United States.

The word ""dollar"" is one of the words in the first paragraph of Section 9 of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. In that context, ""dollars"" is a reference to the Spanish milled dollar, a coin that had a monetary value of 8 Spanish units of currency, or reales. In 1792 the U.S. Congress adopted legislation titled An act establishing a mint, and regulating the Coins of the United States. Section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins, including ""DOLLARS OR UNITS—each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current, and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver"". Section 20 of the act provided, ""That the money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars, or units... and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation"". In other words, this act designated the United States dollar as the unit of currency of the United States.

Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; ""dime"" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢, while ""eagle"" and ""mill"" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599⁄ . When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, ""paper money"" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the ""double eagle"", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as ""fractional currency"", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as ""shinplasters"". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a ""Union"", ""Half Union"", and ""Quarter Union"",[15] thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.

Today, USD notes are made from cotton fiber paper, unlike most common paper, which is made of wood fiber. U.S. coins are produced by the United States Mint. U.S. dollar banknotes are printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and, since 1914, have been issued by the Federal Reserve. The ""large-sized notes"" issued before 1928 measured 7.42 inches (188 mm) by 3.125 inches (79.4 mm); small-sized notes, introduced that year, measure 6.14 inches (156 mm) by 2.61 inches (66 mm) by 0.0043 inches (0.11 mm). When the current, smaller sized U.S. currency was introduced it was referred to as Philippine-sized currency because the Philippines had previously adopted the same size for its legal currency.

In the 16th century, Count Hieronymus Schlick of Bohemia began minting coins known as Joachimstalers (from German thal, or nowadays usually Tal, ""valley"", cognate with ""dale"" in English), named for Joachimstal, the valley where the silver was mined (St. Joachim's Valley, now Jáchymov; then part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic).[16] Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German Taler, a word that eventually found its way into Danish and Swedish as daler, Norwegian as dalar and daler, Dutch as daler or daalder, Ethiopian as ታላሪ (talari), Hungarian as tallér, Italian as tallero, and English as dollar.[16] Alternatively, thaler is said to come from the German coin Guldengroschen (""great guilder"", being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder), minted from the silver from Joachimsthal.

The coins minted at Joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places. One such example, was a Dutch coin depicting a lion, hence its Dutch name leeuwendaler (in English: lion daler).

The leeuwendaler was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .75 fine silver and passed locally for between 36 and 42 stuivers. It was lighter than the large-denomination coins then in circulation, thus it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade.

The leeuwendaler was popular in the Dutch East Indies and in the Dutch New Netherland Colony (New York), and circulated throughout the Thirteen Colonies during the 17th and early 18th centuries. It was also popular throughout Eastern Europe, where it led to the current Romanian and Moldovan currency being called leu (literally ""lion"").

Among the English-speaking community, the coin came to be popularly known as lion dollar – and is the origin of the name dollar.[17] The modern American-English pronunciation of dollar is still remarkably close to the 17th-century Dutch pronunciation of daler.[18]

By analogy with this lion dollar, Spanish pesos – with the same weight and shape as the lion dollar – came to be known as Spanish dollars.[18] By the mid-18th century, the lion dollar had been replaced by the Spanish dollar, the famous ""piece of eight"", which was distributed widely in the Spanish colonies in the New World and in the Philippines.[19] Eventually, dollar became the name of the first official American currency.

The colloquialism ""buck"" (much like the British word ""quid"" for the pound sterling) is often used to refer to dollars of various nations, including the U.S. dollar. This term, dating to the 18th century, may have originated with the colonial leather trade. It may also have originated from a poker term.[20] ""Greenback"" is another nickname originally applied specifically to the 19th century Demand Note dollars created by Abraham Lincoln to finance the costs of the Civil War for the North.[21] The original note was printed in black and green on the back side. It is still used to refer to the U.S. dollar (but not to the dollars of other countries). Other well-known names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include ""greenmail"", ""green"" and ""dead presidents"" (the last because deceased presidents are pictured on most bills).

A ""grand"", sometimes shortened to simply ""G"", is a common term for the amount of $1,000. The suffix ""K"" or ""k"" (from ""kilo-"") is also commonly used to denote this amount (such as ""$10k"" to mean $10,000). However, the $1,000 note is no longer in general use. A ""large"" or ""stack"", it is usually a reference to a multiple of $1,000 (such as ""fifty large"" meaning $50,000). The $100 note is nicknamed ""Benjamin"", ""Ben"", or ""Franklin"" (after Benjamin Franklin), ""C-note"" (C being the Roman numeral for 100), ""Century note"" or ""bill"" (e.g. ""two bills"" being $200). The $50 note is occasionally called a ""yardstick"" or a ""grant"" (after President Ulysses S. Grant, pictured on the obverse). The $20 note is referred to as a ""double sawbuck"", ""Jackson"" (after Andrew Jackson), or ""double eagle"". The $10 note is referred to as a ""sawbuck"", ""ten-spot"" or ""Hamilton"" (after Alexander Hamilton). The $5 note as ""Lincoln"", ""fin"", ""fiver"" or ""five-spot"". The infrequently-used $2 note is sometimes called ""deuce"", ""Tom"", or ""Jefferson"" (after Thomas Jefferson). The $1 note as a ""single"" or ""buck"". The dollar has also been, referred to as a ""bone"" and ""bones"" in plural (e.g. ""twenty bones"" is equal to $20). The newer designs, with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse rather than in cameo insets upon paper color-coded by denomination, are sometimes referred to as ""bigface"" notes or ""Monopoly money"".

In French-speaking areas of Louisiana, the dollar is referred to as ""piastre"" or ""piasse"" (pronounced ""pee-as"") and the French holdover ""sou"" (pronounced ""soo"") is used to refer to the cent.

In El Salvador, the dollar replaced the Salvadoran colón under the presidency of Francisco Flores Pérez.

In Panama, the equivalent of buck is ""palo"" (literally ""stick""). Also, the Panamanian balboa is directly tied to the U.S. dollar, and US dollars are frequently used in place of the minted Panamanian currency.

In Ecuador, the dollar is referred to as ""plata"" (literally ""silver"").

In Peru, a nickname for the U.S. dollar is ""coco"", which is a pet name for Jorge (""George"" in Spanish), a reference to the portrait of George Washington on the $1 note.

Puerto Ricans, both living in Puerto Rico and in the United States, may refer to the dollar as ""peso"".

In some places in Mexico, prices in U.S. dollars are referred to as ""en americano"" (""in American"") or en oro (""in gold""), with the word ""peso"" used in Mexico primarily to refer to the Mexican peso.

Cubans call the U.S. dollar ""fula"", loosely translated from Cuban jargon meaning bad. Possession of American money was penalized before the mid-1990s, hence the nickname.

The symbol $, usually written before the numerical amount, is used for the U.S. dollar (as well as for many other currencies). The sign was the result of a late 18th-century evolution of the scribal abbreviation ""ps"" for the peso. The p and the s eventually came to be written over each other giving rise to $.[22][23][24][25]

Another popular explanation is that it comes from the Pillars of Hercules on the Spanish Coat of arms on the Spanish dollars that were minted in the New World mints in Mexico City, Mexico; Potosí, Bolivia; and Lima, Peru. These Pillars of Hercules on the silver Spanish dollar coins take the form of two vertical bars (||) and a swinging cloth band in the shape of an ""S"".

Yet another explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from the capital letters U and S written or printed one on top of the other. This theory, popularized by novelist Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged,[26] does not consider the fact that the symbol was already in use before the formation of the United States.[27]

The first dollar coins issued by the United States Mint (founded 1792) were similar in size and composition to the Spanish dollar. The Spanish, U.S. silver dollars, and Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the United States, and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso remained legal tender until 1857. The coinage of various English colonies also circulated. The lion dollar was popular in the Dutch New Netherland Colony (New York), but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the English colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century. Examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable, thus they were sometimes referred to as ""dog dollars"".[28]

The U.S. dollar was created by the Constitution and defined by the Coinage Act of 1792. It specified a ""dollar"" to be based in the Spanish milled dollar and of 371 grains and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or 416 grains (27.0 g) of standard silver and an ""eagle"" to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or 270 grains (17 g) of gold (again depending on purity).[29] The choice of the value 371 grains arose from Alexander Hamilton's decision to base the new American unit on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. Hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of Spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains. A new Spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight, and so the new U.S. dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar.

The Coinage Act of 1792 set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars, and the dollar at 1,10 eagle. It called for 90% silver alloy coins in denominations of 1, 1,2, 1,4, 1,10, and 1,20 dollars; it called for 90% gold alloy coins in denominations of 1, 1,2, 1,4, and 1,10 eagles.

The value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods. This allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time, except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation's economy.

The early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents, as is the custom now;[30] although today, by law, only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency.[31] In fact, the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency, a practice compared to the policies of European monarchs.[32] The currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century; before that ""heads"" side of coinage used profile faces and striding, seated, and standing figures from Greek and Roman mythology and composite native Americans. The last coins to be converted to profiles of historic Americans were the dime (1946) and the Dollar (1971).

In 1775, the United States and the individual states began issuing ""Continental Currency"" denominated in Spanish dollars and (for the issues of the states) the £sd currencies of the states. The dollar was valued relative to the states' currencies at the following rates:

The continental currency suffered from printing press inflation and was replaced by the silver dollar at the rate of 1 silver dollar = 1000 continental dollars.

From 1792, when the Mint Act was passed, the dollar was defined as 371.25 grains (24.056 g) of silver. Many historians[who?] erroneously assume gold was standardized at a fixed rate in parity with silver; however, there is no evidence of Congress making this law. This has to do with Alexander Hamilton's suggestion to Congress of a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold, respectively. The gold coins that were minted however, were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a market value relative to the Congressional standard of the silver dollar. 1834 saw a shift in the gold standard to 23.2 grains (1.50 g), followed by a slight adjustment to 23.22 grains (1.505 g) in 1837 (16:1 ratio).[citation needed]

In 1862, paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals, due to the Civil War. Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated. This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the War of 1812. The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788. With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited, the continentals quickly lost their value, giving rise to the phrase ""not worth a continental"". This was a primary reason for the ""No state shall... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts"" clause in article 1, section 10 of the United States Constitution.

The Gold Standard Act of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as 23.22 grains (1.505 g) of gold, equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $20.67. Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters, and the half dollar was reduced to 40% silver. Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970. Gold coins were confiscated by Executive Order 6102 issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt. The gold standard was changed to 13.71 grains (0.888 g), equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $35. This standard persisted until 1968.

Between 1968 and 1975, a variety of pegs to gold were put in place, eventually culminating in a sudden end, on August 15, 1971, to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the Nixon Shock. The last peg was $42.22 per ounce[citation needed] before the U.S. dollar was let to freely float on currency markets.

According to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the largest note it ever printed was the $100,000 Gold Certificate, Series 1934. These notes were printed from December 18, 1934, through January 9, 1935, and were issued by the Treasurer of the United States to Federal Reserve Banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the Treasury. These notes were used for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the general public.

Official United States coins have been produced every year from 1792 to the present.

Technically, all these coins are still legal tender at face value, though some are far more valuable today for their numismatic value, and for gold and silver coins, their precious metal value. From 1965 to 1970 the Kennedy half dollar was the only circulating coin with any silver content, which was removed in 1971 and replaced with cupronickel. However, since 1992, the U.S. Mint has produced special Silver Proof Sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes, quarters, and half dollars in place of the standard copper-nickel versions. In addition, an experimental $4.00 (Stella) coin was also minted in 1879, but never placed into circulation, and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination.

The $50 coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915) celebrating the opening of the Panama Canal. Only 1,128 were made, 645 of which were octagonal; this remains the only U.S. coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest U.S. coin ever produced.

From 1934 to present, the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar and dollar. The nickel is the only coin still in use today that is essentially unchanged (except in its design) from its original version. Every year since 1866, the nickel has been 75% copper and 25% nickel, except for 4 years during World War II when nickel was needed for the war.

The United States Mint produces Proof Sets specifically for collectors and speculators. Silver Proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime, quarter, and half dollar containing 90% silver. Starting in 1983 and ending in 1997, the Mint also produced proof sets containing the year's commemorative coins alongside the regular coins. Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar Proof Set where four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a president. Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new Presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 11, 2011, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Future minting of such coins will be made solely for collectors.[33]

The first United States dollar was minted in 1794. Known as the Flowing Hair Dollar, it contained 416 grains of ""standard silver"" (89.25% silver and 10.75% copper), as specified by Section 13[34] of the Coinage Act of 1792. It was designated by Section 9 of that Act as having ""the value of a Spanish milled dollar"".

Dollar coins have not been very popular in the United States.[35]Silver dollars were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935; a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size, featuring President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was minted from 1971 through 1978. Gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century. The Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was introduced in 1979; these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters, due to their nearly equal size, their milled edge, and their similar color. Minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 (collectors' pieces were struck in 1981), but, as with all past U.S. coins, they remain legal tender. As the number of Anthony dollars held by the Federal Reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted, additional Anthony dollars were struck in 1999. In 2000, a new $1 coin, featuring Sacagawea, (the Sacagawea dollar) was introduced, which corrected some of the problems of the Anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color, without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar. However, this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing $1 bill and is rarely used in daily transactions. The failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.[36]

In February 2007, the U.S. Mint, under the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005,[37] introduced a new $1 U.S. Presidential dollar coin. Based on the success of the ""50 State Quarters"" series, the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations, starting with George Washington, on the obverse side. The reverse side features the Statue of Liberty. To allow for larger, more detailed portraits, the traditional inscriptions of ""E Pluribus Unum"", ""In God We Trust"", the year of minting or issuance, and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face. This feature, similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the British £1 coin, is not usually associated with U.S. coin designs. The inscription ""Liberty"" has been eliminated, with the Statue of Liberty serving as a sufficient replacement. In addition, due to the nature of U.S. coins, this will be the first time there will be circulating U.S. coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse (heads) side (Lincoln,penny, Jefferson,nickel, Franklin D. Roosevelt,dime, Washington,quarter, Kennedy,half dollar, and Eisenhower,dollar). Another unusual fact about the new $1 coin is Grover Cleveland will have two coins with his portrait issued due to the fact he was the only U.S. President to be elected to two non-consecutive terms.[38]

Early releases of the Washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks. Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions ""E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P"". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to ""heads"", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying ""upside down lettering error"" coins.[39] Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only $1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.

Note 1: The letter ""P"" is used for the Philadelphia mint mark on all coins (except pennies) released from 1980 onward. Before this it had been used on silver Jefferson nickels from 1942 to 1945.

Note 2: During the Civil War, this mint operated under the control of the State of Louisiana (February 1861) and the Confederate States of America (March 1861) until it ran out of bullion later in that year; some Half Dollars have been identified as being the issue of the State of Louisiana and the Confederacy.

Note 3: Press Number 1 is still in use by the Nevada State Museum; it produces tokens for the Reno Coin Club.

Note 4: Although the mint mark ""D"" is used for two separate mints, it is easy to distinguish between the two; any antebellum coinage (up to 1861) is Dahlonega, and any 20th century or later coinage is Denver.

Note 5: Between 1973 and 1986 there was no mint mark; these coins are indistinguishable from coins produced at the Philadelphia Mint (note 1 notwithstanding): after 1988 the letter ""W"" was used for coinage (except for the 2009 Ultra High Relief Double Eagle).

The U.S. Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power to ""borrow money on the credit of the United States"".[40] Congress has exercised that power by authorizing Federal Reserve Banks to issue Federal Reserve Notes. Those notes are ""obligations of the United States"" and ""shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve bank"".[41] Federal Reserve Notes are designated by law as ""legal tender"" for the payment of debts.[42] Congress has also authorized the issuance of more than 10 other types of banknotes, including the United States Note[43] and the Federal Reserve Bank Note. The Federal Reserve Note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s.

Currently printed denominations are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime; it was the latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details. These notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.

Though still predominantly green, post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations. As a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the American Council of the Blind, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note, except the $1 and the version of the $100 bill already in process. It also plans larger, higher-contrast numerals, more color differences, and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period.[44]

The monetary base consists of coins and Federal Reserve Notes in circulation outside the Federal Reserve Banks and the U.S. Treasury, plus deposits held by depository institutions at Federal Reserve Banks. The adjusted monetary base has increased from approximately 400 billion dollars in 1994, to 800 billion in 2005, and over 3000 billion in 2013.[45] The amount of cash in circulation is increased (or decreased) by the actions of the Federal Reserve System. Eight times a year, the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee meet to determine US monetary policy.[46] Every business day, the Federal Reserve System engages in Open market operations to carry out that monetary policy.[47] If the Federal Reserve desires to increase the money supply, it will buy securities (such as US Treasury Bonds) anonymously from banks in exchange for dollars. Conversely, it will sell securities to the banks in exchange for dollars, to take dollars out of circulation.[48]

When the Federal Reserve makes a purchase, it credits the seller's reserve account (with the Federal Reserve). This money is not transferred from any existing funds—it is at this point that the Federal Reserve has created new high-powered money. Commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the Federal Reserve. To fulfill those requests, the Federal Reserve places an order for printed money from the US Treasury Department.[49] The Treasury Department in turn sends these requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (to print new dollar bills) and the Bureau of the Mint (to stamp the coins).

Usually, the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target. In other instances, monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold. For example, in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets the federal funds rate, the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight. The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include: (i) Discount window lending (as lender of last resort); (ii) Fractional deposit lending (changes in the reserve requirement); (iii) Moral suasion (cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes); (iv) ""Open mouth operations"" (talking monetary policy with the market).

The 6th paragraph of Section 8 of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides that the U.S. Congress shall have the power to ""coin money"" and to ""regulate the value"" of domestic and foreign coins. Congress exercised those powers when it enacted the Coinage Act of 1792. That Act provided for the minting of the first U.S. dollar and it declared that the U.S. dollar shall have ""the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current"".[50]

The table to the right shows the equivalent amount of goods that, in a particular year, could be purchased with $1. The table shows that from 1774 through 2012 the U.S. dollar has lost about 97.0% of its buying power.[51]

The decline in the value of the U.S. dollar corresponds to price inflation, which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.[52] A consumer price index (CPI) is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services purchased by households. The United States Consumer Price Index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services in the United States.[53] It reflects inflation as experienced by consumers in their day-to-day living expenses.[54] A graph showing the U.S. CPI relative to 1982–1984 and the annual year-over-year change in CPI is shown at right.

The value of the U.S. dollar declined significantly during wartime, especially during the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II.[55] The Federal Reserve, which was established in 1913, was designed to furnish an ""elastic"" currency subject to ""substantial changes of quantity over short periods"", which differed significantly from previous forms of high-powered money such as gold, national bank notes, and silver coins.[56] Over the very long run, the prior gold standard kept prices stable—for instance, the price level and the value of the U.S. dollar in 1914 was not very different from the price level in the 1880s. The Federal Reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the U.S. dollar and price stability, reversing the inflation caused by the First World War and stabilizing the value of the dollar during the 1920s, before presiding over a 30% deflation in U.S. prices in the 1930s.[57]

Under the Bretton Woods system established after World War II, the value of gold was fixed to $35 per ounce, and the value of the U.S. dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold. Rising government spending in the 1960s, however, led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility, gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold, and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline. Facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the United States would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold, gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by President Nixon, resulting in the ""Nixon shock"".[58]

The value of the U.S. dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold, and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the value of the U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money supply, resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s. This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked (the Phillips curve), and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign.[58] Between 1965 and 1981, the U.S. dollar lost two thirds of its value.[51]

In 1979, President Carter appointed Paul Volcker Chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve tightened the money supply and inflation was substantially lower in the 1980s, and hence the value of the U.S. dollar stabilized.[58]

Over the thirty-year period from 1981 to 2009, the U.S. dollar lost over half its value.[51] This is because the Federal Reserve has targeted not zero inflation, but a low, stable rate of inflation—between 1987 and 1997, the rate of inflation was approximately 3.5%, and between 1997 and 2007 it was approximately 2%. The so-called ""Great Moderation"" of economic conditions since the 1970s is credited to monetary policy targeting price stability.[58]

There is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation (which would mean a constant value for the U.S. dollar over time) or low, stable inflation (which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time, as is the case now). Although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the U.S. dollar,[57] others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed.[59]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(currency)	"In many national currencies, the cent, commonly represented by the cent sign (a minuscule letter ""c"" crossed by a diagonal stroke or a vertical line: ¢; or a simple ""c"") is a monetary unit that equals 1⁄ of the basic monetary unit. Etymologically, the word cent derives from the Latin word ""centum"" meaning hundred. Cent also refers to a coin worth one cent.

In the United States and Canada, the 1¢ coin is generally known by the nickname penny, alluding to the British coin and unit of that name. In Ireland the 1c coin is also sometimes known as a penny in reference to the Irish penny,[citation needed] worth 1⁄ of the Irish pound that was replaced by the euro in 2002.

A cent is commonly represented by the cent sign, a minuscule letter ""c"" crossed by a diagonal stroke or a vertical line: ¢; or a simple ""c"", depending on the currency (see below). Cent amounts from 1 cent to 99 cents can be represented as one or two digits followed by the appropriate abbreviation (2¢, 5¢, 75¢, 99¢), or as a subdivision of the base unit ($0.99).

The cent sign has not survived the changeover from typewriters to computer keyboards (replaced positionally by the caret). There are alternative ways, however, to create the character (offset 162) in most common code pages, including Unicode and Windows-1252:

Usage of the cent symbol varies from one currency to another. In the United States and Canada, the usage ¢ is more common, while in Australia, New Zealand and the eurozone, the c is more common.[citation needed] In South Africa and Ireland, only the c is used.[citation needed]

When written in English, the cent sign (¢ or c) follows the amount (with no space between), in contrast with a larger currency symbol, which is placed before the amount. For example, 2¢ and $0.02, or 2c and €0.02.

Mints in developed countries usually create coins with values between the equivalent of approximately US$0.05 and US$5, while reserving banknotes for higher values. As inflation lowers the value of currencies, many have replaced the lowest-valued banknotes with coins (Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, pound sterling), removed the lowest-valued coins from circulation, and,or introduced higher-valued bills. The US dollar is a notable exception, using a $1 bill along with a (less-popular) coin, whereas most other industrialized nations use solely a coin for the approximate equivalent value (and greater).

Other monetary unit subdivision systems are possible, such as the British pound sterling, which until decimalisation in 1971 was subdivided into 20 shillings (s), of 12 old pence (d) each, making a pound equivalent to 240 pence.

Examples of currencies around the world featuring centesimal (1⁄ ) units called cent, or related words from the same root such as céntimo, centésimo, centavo or sen, are:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_United_States_dollar	"Coins of the United States dollar were first minted in 1792. New coins have been produced annually since then and they make up a valuable aspect of the United States currency system. Today, circulating coins exist in denominations of 1¢ (i.e. 1 cent or $0.01), 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢, and $1.00. Also minted are bullion (including gold, silver and platinum) and commemorative coins. All of these are produced by the United States Mint. The coins are then sold to Federal Reserve Banks which in turn are responsible for putting coins into circulation and withdrawing them as demanded by the country's economy.

Today four mints operate in the United States producing billions of coins each year. The main mint is the Philadelphia Mint,[1] which produces circulating coinage, mint sets and some commemorative coins. The Denver Mint[2] also produces circulating coinage, mint sets and commemoratives. The San Francisco Mint[3] produces regular and silver proof coinage, and produced circulating coinage until the 1970s. The West Point Mint[4] produces bullion coinage (including proofs). Philadelphia and Denver produce the dies used at all of the mints. The proof and mint sets are manufactured each year and contain examples of all of the year's circulating coins.

The producing mint of each coin may be easily identified, as most coins bear a mint mark. The identifying letter of the mint can be found on the front side of most coins, and is often placed near the year. Unmarked coins are issued by the Philadelphia mint. Among marked coins, Philadelphia coins bear a letter P, (except for cents, which display no mint mark if made by the Philadelphia mint) Denver coins bear a letter D, San Francisco coins bear a letter S, and West Point coins bear a letter W. S and W coins are rarely, if ever, found in general circulation, although S coins bearing dates prior to the mid-1970s are in circulation. The CC, O, C, and D mint marks were used on gold and silver coins for various periods in the mid-nineteenth century until the early twentieth century by temporary mints in Carson City, Nevada; New Orleans, Louisiana; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Dahlonega, Georgia; respectively: most such coins still extant are now in the hands of collectors and museums.

Non-circulating bullion coins have been produced each year since 1986. They can be found in silver, gold and also platinum since 1997. The face value of these coins is legal as tender, but does not actually reflect the value of the precious metal contained therein. On May 11, 2011, Utah became the first state to accept these coins as the value of the precious metal in common transactions. The Utah State Treasurer assigns a numerical precious metal value to these coins each week based on the spot metal prices.

Modern commemoratives have been minted since 1982. An incomplete list is available here.

Note: It is a common misconception that ""eagle""-based nomenclature for gold U.S. coinage was merely slang. This is not the case. The ""eagle,"" ""half-eagle"" and ""quarter-eagle"" were specifically given these names in the Coinage Act of 1792. Likewise, the double eagle was specifically created as such by name (""An Act to authorize the Coinage of Gold Dollars and Double Eagles"", title and section 1, March 3, 1849).

Some modern commemorative coins have been minted in the silver dollar, half-eagle and eagle denominations.

See also US coin sizes, showing all major US coin series and scaled images in a single chart.

The law governing obsolete, mutilated, and worn coins and currency, including types which are no longer in production (e.g. Indian cents), can be found in 31 U.S.C. § 5120.

Although the term mill (or mille) was defined in the 18th century as 1⁄ of a dollar or 0.1¢, no coin smaller than 0.5¢ has ever been officially minted in the U.S. However, unofficial mill coins, also called ""tenth cent"" or ""tax-help coins"", made of diverse materials—plastic, wood, tin, and others—were produced as late as the 1960s by some states, localities, and private businesses for tax payments and to render change for small purchases.

For historical reasons the size of the coins does not increase with their face value. Both the one-cent and the five-cent are larger than the ten-cent and the less common 50-cent coin is larger than the recent Sacagawea and Susan B. Anthony dollar coins, and the newer same-sized Presidential $1 Coins. The sizes of the dime, quarter, and half dollar are holdovers from before 1965 when they were made from 90% silver and 10% copper; their sizes thus depended upon the amount of silver needed to equal the face value. The diameter of the current dollar coins was introduced in 1979 with the Susan B. Anthony dollar not only as a concession to the vending machine industry which wanted a smaller dollar coin usable in their machines but also as an increase in the amount of seigniorage for the US Government (the difference between what a piece of money costs to produce and its face value or the profit margin).

The four coin types in common circulation today have not had their sizes or denominations changed in well over a century, although their weights have been reduced due to the substitution of cheaper metals in their manufacture. Businesses usually have to keep adequate amounts in coin on hand, so as to be able to make change in fractional dollar amounts. Since they do not receive the coins they need through regular trade, there is often a one-way flow of coins from the banks to the retailers, who often have to pay fees for it.[citation needed]

Furthermore, apart from some dollar coins, U.S. coins do not indicate their value in numerals, but in English words, and the value descriptions do not follow a consistent pattern, referring to three different units, and expressions in fractions: ""One Cent""; ""Five Cents""; ""One Dime""; ""Quarter Dollar""; the values of the coins must therefore be learned.

Due to the penny's low value, some efforts have been made to eliminate the penny as circulating coinage.[6][7]"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_dollar_(United_States_coin)	"Half dollar coins have been produced every year since the conception of the United States Mint in 1794. Sometimes referred to as the fifty-cent piece, the only other U.S. coin that has been minted as consistently is the cent.

Half-dollar coins saw heavy use, particularly in the first half of the twentieth century. For many years, they were commonly used in casinos. Rolls of half dollars may still be kept on hand in cardrooms for games requiring 50-cent antes or bring-in bets, for dealers to pay winning naturals in blackjack, or where the house collects a rake in increments. Additionally, some concession vendors at sporting events distribute half-dollar coins as change for convenience.

By the early 1960s, the rising price of silver was nearing the point where the bullion value of U.S. silver coins would exceed face value. In 1965, the U.S. introduced layered composition coins made of a copper core laminated between two cupro-nickel outer faces. The silver content of dimes and quarters was totally eliminated, but the Kennedy half dollar composition still contained silver (reduced from 90 to 40 percent) from 1965 to 1970.

The 1964 Kennedy half dollars were removed from circulation by the public for sentimental reasons.[citation needed] Those issued through the end of the 1960s were hoarded as the only precious metal U.S. coins remaining in production, and as the price of silver continued to rise, pre-1964 halves disappeared from circulation as well. By the time that the coin's composition was changed to match that of the clad dimes and quarters in 1971, both businesses and the public had adapted to a country in which the half dollar did not generally circulate. The quarter took over the half's role as the highest-value component of change.

Most coins enter circulation through the change drawers of businesses. Few businesses stock their change drawers with half dollars, and many banks do not stock them or hand them out as normal business practice, so the coins do not see much circulation.

Most U.S. vending machines do not accept half dollars, nor do payphones, which further curtails their circulation; however, most sleight of hand magicians specializing in coin magic around the world prefer the half dollar for its size and weight,[citation needed] and it is the most common denomination used for U.S. commemorative coins.[citation needed]

Since 2002, half dollars have been minted only for collectors, due to large Federal Reserve and government inventories on hand of pre-2001 pieces; this is mostly due to lack of demand and large quantity returns from casino slot machines that now operate ""coinless"".[citation needed] If and when the reserve supply runs low, the mint will again fill orders for circulation half dollars.[citation needed] It took about 18 years (1981–1999) for the large inventory stockpile of a similar low-demand circulation coin, the $1 coin, to reach reserve levels low enough to again produce circulation pieces.[citation needed] Modern-date half dollars can be purchased in proof sets, mint sets, rolls, and bags from the U.S. Mint, and existing inventory circulation pieces can be ordered through most US banks. All collector issues since 2001 have had much lower mintages than in previous years. Although intended only for collectors, these post-2001 half dollars sometimes find their way into circulation.[citation needed]"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent	"Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), better known by his stage name 50 Cent, is an American rapper, singer, entrepreneur, investor and actor from New York City. Born in the South Jamaica neighborhood of the borough of Queens, Jackson began selling drugs at age twelve during the 1980s crack epidemic. Although he left drug-dealing to pursue a musical career, he was struck by nine bullets in a 2000 shooting. After Jackson released the compilation album Guess Who's Back? in 2002, he was discovered by Eminem and signed by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records.

With the aid of Eminem and Dr. Dre (who produced his first major-label album, Get Rich or Die Tryin'), Jackson became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence with East Coast hip hop group G-Unit (which he leads de facto). In 2003 he founded G-Unit Records, signing his G-Unit associates Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Jackson had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, The Massacre, which was released in 2005. He released his fifth studio album, Animal Ambition, in 2014 and is working on his sixth studio album: Street King Immortal, scheduled for release in 2015.

During his career Jackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards.[1] He has pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2005), the Iraq War film Home of the Brave (2006) and Righteous Kill (2008). 50 Cent was ranked the sixth-best artist of the 2000s, the third-best rapper (behind Eminem and Nelly), and Get Rich or Die Tryin' and The Massacre were ranked the 12th and 37th best albums of the decade by Billboard.

Jackson was born and raised in the South Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York City. He was raised by his mother, Sabrina, who gave birth to him when she was fifteen. A cocaine dealer, Sabrina raised Jackson until she was murdered when Jackson was eight. She lost consciousness after an unknown assailant drugged her drink; the assailant then turned on the gas and closed the windows of her apartment.[2][3] After his mother's death, Jackson moved into his grandparents' house with his eight aunts and uncles.[4][5][6] The rapper recalled, ""My grandmother told me, 'Your mother's not coming home. She's not gonna come back to pick you up. You're gonna stay with us now.' That's when I started adjusting to the streets a little bit.""[7]

He began boxing at about age 11, and when he was 14 a neighbor opened a boxing gym for local youth. ""When I wasn't killing time in school, I was sparring in the gym or selling crack on the strip,"" Jackson remembered.[8] During the mid-1980s, he competed in the Junior Olympics: ""I was competitive in the ring and hip-hop is competitive too ... I think rappers condition themselves like boxers, so they all kind of feel like they're the champ.""[9] At age 12, Jackson began dealing narcotics when his grandparents thought he was in after-school programs[10] and brought guns and drug money to school. In the tenth grade, he was caught by metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School: ""I was embarrassed that I got arrested like that ... After I got arrested I stopped hiding it. I was telling my grandmother [openly], 'I sell drugs.'""[7]

On June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine and a starting pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp and earned his GED. He has said that he did not use cocaine himself.[4][11][12] Jackson adopted the nickname ""50 Cent"" as a metaphor for change.[13] The name was inspired by Kelvin Martin, a 1980s Brooklyn robber known as ""50 Cent""; Jackson chose it ""because it says everything I want it to say. I'm the same kind of person 50 Cent was. I provide for myself by any means.""[14]

Jackson began rapping in a friend's basement, where he used turntables to record over instrumentals.[15] In 1996 a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, who was establishing Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught him how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs and make records.[16][17] Jackson's first appearance was on ""React"" with Onyx, for their 1998 album Shut 'Em Down. He credited Jam Master Jay for improving his ability to write hooks,[9] and Jay produced Jackson's first (unreleased) album.[2] In 1999, after Jackson left Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to an upstate New York studio, where he produced thirty-six songs in two weeks;[3] eighteen were included on his 2000 album, Power of the Dollar.[18] Jackson founded Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit member Bang 'Em Smurf.[19][20]

Jackson's popularity began to grow after the successful, controversial underground single ""How to Rob"", which he wrote in a half-hour car ride to a studio.[13][21] The track comically describes how he would rob famous artists. Jackson explained the song's rationale: ""There's a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant"".[13] Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, DMX, Wyclef Jean and the Wu-Tang Clan responded to the track,[21] and Nas invited Jackson to join him on his Nastradamus tour.[6] Although ""How to Rob"" was intended to be released with ""Thug Love"" (with Destiny's Child), two days before he was scheduled to film the ""Thug Love"" music video Jackson was shot and hospitalized.[22]

On April 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman (alleged to be Darryl ""Hommo"" Baum) outside his grandmother's former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend's car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard.[3] After Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a 9mm handgun. Jackson was shot in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest and left cheek.[2][7][23] His facial wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth and a slightly slurred voice;[6][7][24] his friend was wounded in the hand. They were driven to a hospital, where Jackson spent thirteen days. Baum, Mike Tyson's close friend and bodyguard,[25] was killed three weeks later.[26]

Jackson recalled the shooting: ""It happens so fast that you don't even get a chance to shoot back .... I was scared the whole time ... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, 'Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.'""[7] In his autobiography, From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens, he wrote: ""After I got shot nine times at close range and didn't die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I'm gone"".[4] After using a walker for six weeks, Jackson was fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital he stayed in the Poconos with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique.[2][7][27]

In the hospital Jackson signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records before he was dropped from the label and blacklisted by the recording industry because of his song, ""Ghetto Qu'ran"". Unable to work in a U.S. studio, he went to Canada.[28][29] With business partner Sha Money XL, Jackson recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes to build a reputation. In a HitQuarters interview, Marc Labelle of Shady Records A&R said that Jackson used the mixtape circuit to his advantage: ""He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them.""[30] Jackson's popularity increased, and in 2002 he released the mixtape Guess Who's Back?. He then released 50 Cent Is the Future backed by G-Unit, a mixtape revisiting material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.[18]

In 2002 Eminem heard Jackson's Guess Who's Back? CD, received from Jackson's attorney (who was working with Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg).[22] Impressed, Eminem invited Jackson to fly to Los Angeles and introduced him to Dr. Dre.[2][16][22] After signing a $1 million record deal,[16] Jackson released No Mercy, No Fear. The mixtape featured one new track, ""Wanksta"", which appeared on Eminem's 8 Mile soundtrack.[18] Jackson was also signed by Chris Lighty's Violator Management and Sha Money XL's Money Management Group.

Jackson released his debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin' (described by AllMusic as ""probably the most hyped debut album by a rap artist in about a decade""), in February 2003.[31]Rolling Stone noted its ""dark synth grooves, buzzy keyboards and a persistently funky bounce"", with Jackson complementing the production in ""an unflappable, laid-back flow"".[32] It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 872,000 copies in its first four days.[33] The lead single, ""In da Club"" (noted by The Source for its ""blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps""),[34] set a Billboard record as the most listened-to song in radio history within a week.[35]

Interscope gave Jackson his own label, G-Unit Records, in 2003.[36] He signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as members of G-Unit, and The Game was later signed in a joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. In March 2005 Jackson's second commercial album, The Massacre, sold 1.14 million copies in its first four days (the highest in an abbreviated sales cycle[33]) and was number one on the Billboard 200 for six weeks.[37] He was the first solo artist with three singles in the Billboard top five in the same week with ""Candy Shop"", ""Disco Inferno"" and ""How We Do"".[38] According to Rolling Stone, ""50's secret weapon is his singing voice - the deceptively amateur-sounding tenor croon that he deploys on almost every chorus"".[39]

After The Game's departure Jackson signed Olivia and rap veterans Mobb Deep to G-Unit Records, with Spider Loc, M.O.P., 40 Glocc and Young Hot Rod later joining the label.[40][41] Jackson expressed an interest in working with rappers other than G-Unit, such as Lil' Scrappy of BME, LL Cool J of Def Jam, Mase of Bad Boy and Freeway of Roc-A-Fella, and recorded with several.[42]

In September 2007 Jackson released his third album, Curtis, which was inspired by his life before Get Rich or Die Tryin‍ '​.[43] It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 691,000 copies during its first week[44] (behind Kanye West's Graduation, released the same day). On the September 10, 2008 episode of Total Request Live Jackson said his fourth studio album, Before I Self Destruct, would be ""done and released in November"". He released ""Ok, You're Right"", produced by Dr. Dre for Before I Self Destruct, on May 18, 2009 and was scheduled to appear in a fall 2009 episode of VH1's Behind the Music. On September 3, 2009 Jackson posted a video [45] for the Soundkillers' Phoenix-[46] produced track, ""Flight 187"", introducing his mixtape and book (The 50th Law). The song, with lyrics inspiring speculation about tension between Jackson and Jay Z, was a bonus track on the iTunes version of Before I Self Destruct.[47]

In a Contactmusic.com interview Jackson said he was working on a Eurodance album, Black Magic, inspired by European nightclubs: ""First they played hip-hop which suddenly changed to uptempo songs, known as Eurodance"".[48] He later said he had changed his next album to The Return of the Heartless Monster after writing different material when he returned home from the Invitation Tour in 2010, shelving Black Magic.[49][50] On September 3 Jackson supported Eminem on his and Jay-Z's The Home & Home Tour, performing ""Crack A Bottle"" with Eminem and Dr. Dre amid rumors of tension between Jackson and Dre.[51][52]

He ""recorded 20 songs to a whole different album concept"" before putting them aside,[53] wanting his new album to have the ""aggression"" of Get Rich or Die Tryin‍ '​.[54][55] Jackson tweeted that the album was ""80 percent done"" and fans could expect it in the summer of 2011. It was ultimately delayed a year due to disagreements with Interscope Records, with Jackson saying that he would release it in November 2011[56] with a different title than Black Magic.[56] Eminem would appear on the album, and Jackson said he was working with new producers such as Boi-1da and Alex da Kid.[57] Cardiak, who produced Lloyd Banks' ""Start It Up"", confirmed that he produced a song for the upcoming album.[58]

Jackson released a song, ""Outlaw"", from his fifth album on the Internet on June 16, 2011.[59] The single, produced by Cardiak, was released on iTunes on July 19[60] (although Jackson tweeted that it was not the album's first single).[61] The rapper planned to write a semi-autobiographical young-adult novel about bullying, different from his previous books which focused on his life and the rules of power. According to the book's publisher, the first-person novel (about a 13-year-old schoolyard bully ""who finds redemption as he faces what he's done"")[62] was scheduled for publication in January 2012.

In a series of tweets Jackson explained that the delay of his fifth album was due to disagreements with Interscope Records,[56] later suggesting that it would be released in November 2011 with his headphone line (SMS by 50).[56] He speculated to MTV News about not renewing his five-album contract with Interscope: ""I don't know ... It will all be clear in the negotiations following me turning this actual album in. And, of course, the performance and how they actually treat the work will determine whether you still want to stay in that position or not.""[63]

On June 20, 2011, Jackson announced the release of Before I Self Destruct II after his fifth album.[64] Although he planned to shoot a music video for the fifth album's lead single, ""I'm On It"", on June 26[65] the video was never filmed.[66] Jackson told Shade45, ""I did four songs in Detroit with Eminem. I did two with Just Blaze, a Boi-1da joint, and I did something with Alex da Kid. We made two that are definite singles and the other two are the kinds of records that we been making, more aimed at my core audience, more aggressive, more of a different kind of energy to it.""[67] He released ""Street King Energy Track #7"" in September 2011 to promote Street King, his charity-based energy drink.[68] An announcement that Jackson was shooting a music video for ""Girls Go Wild"", the fifth-album lead single featuring Jeremih, was made on September 28, 2011.[69][70]

Jackson's fifth album, Street King Immortal, was initially scheduled for a summer 2012 release and postponed until November 13.[71][72] Disagreements with Interscope Records about its release and promotion led to its temporary cancellation. Its first promo single, ""New Day"" with Dr. Dre and Alicia Keys, was released on July 27. The song was produced by Dr. Dre, mixed by Eminem and written by 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Royce da 5'9"" and Dr. Dre. A solo version by Keys was leaked by her husband, Swizz Beatz. ""My Life"", the album's second promo single (with Eminem and Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine), was released on November 26, 2012.

In January 2014 Jackson said he planned to release Animal Ambition in the first quarter of the year, followed by Street King Immortal.[73][74] On February 20 he left Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope, signing with Caroline Records and Capitol Records.[75] According to Jackson, although he owed Interscope another album he was released from his contract because of his friendship with Eminem and Dr. Dre: ""I'm a special case and situation. It's also because of the leverage of having the strong relationships with Eminem and Dr. Dre. They don't want me to be uncomfortable. They value our friendship to the point that they would never want [to jeopardize] it over that little bit of money.""[76] That day, he announced that Animal Ambition would be released on June 3[77] and released its first track. The song, ""Funeral"", was released with a video on Forbes.com. Produced by Jake One, it is a continuation of ""50 Bars"" from a previous album; two more tracks were scheduled for release on March 18.[78] At South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, Jackson performed ""Hold On"" from the new album.[79] That song and ""Don't Worry 'Bout It"" were released with accompanying videos on March 18.[80] According to Jackson, prosperity would be a theme of the album: ""This project, I had to search for a concept, a really good concept, in my perspective, and that was prosperity. I outlined all the things that would be a part of prosperity, positive and negative [for Animal Ambition]."" [81]

On May 14, 2015, 50 Cent revealed in an interview that the first single from Street King Immortal, would be previewed memorial day weekend and would likely be released in June.[82] 50 Cent, released ""Get Low"" on May 20, 2015, as the lead single from his sixth studio album, Street King Immortal (2015). The song, produced by Remo the Hitmaker, features vocals from fellow American rappers 2 Chainz and T.I., as well as American singer Jeremih.[83] He announced bankrputcy on July 13, 2015.[84]

Jackson has had a successful business career, founding G-Unit Records in 2003.[85] In November 2003, he signed a five-year deal with Reebok to distribute a G-Unit Sneakers line for his G-Unit Clothing Company.[86][87]

One of Jackson's first business ventures was being a beverage investor with Glacéau to create an enhanced water drink called Formula 50. In October 2004, 50 Cent was given a minority share in the company in exchange for becoming a spokesperson after learning that he was a fan of the beverage. The health conscious Jackson noted that he first learned of the product while at a gym in Los Angeles, and stated that ""they do such a good job making water taste good."" After becoming a shareholder and endorser, Jackson worked with the company to create a new grape-flavored ""Formula 50"" variant of VitaminWater and mentioned the drinks in various songs and interviews. In 2007, Coca-Cola purchased Glacéau for $4.1 billion and, according to Forbes, Jackson, who was a minority shareholder, earned $100 million from the deal after taxes.[88] Though he no longer has an equity stake in the company, Jackson continues to act as a spokesperson for Vitaminwater, enthusiastically supporting the product including singing about it at the BET Awards and expressing his excitement over the company's continuing to allow his input on products.[89] He joined Right Guard to introduce a body spray (Pure 50 RGX) and endorsed Magic Stick condoms,[90] planning to donate part of their proceeds to increasing HIV awareness.[91] Jackson signed a multi-year deal with Steiner Sports to sell his memorabilia,[92] and announced plans for a dietary-supplement company in conjunction with his film Spectacular Regret in August 2007.[93]

Jackson has founded two film-production companies: G-Unit Films in 2003 and Cheetah Vision in 2008.[94][95] When G-Unit Films folded he focused on Cheetah Vision,[96] and in 2010 the company obtained $200 million in funding.[97]

In July 2011 Jackson launched a philanthropic initiative to provide food for one billion starving people in Africa by 2016, joining Pure Growth Partners to introduce Street King. A portion of the proceeds from each Street King purchase would be used to provide a daily meal to an underprivileged child. The partnership coincides with Jackson's goal to feed a billion people in Africa during the next five years. ""50 Cent and I share a common vision: to address the world's problems through smart and sustainable business models,"" said Chris Clarke, founder and CEO of Pure Growth Partners. ""With the rampant starvation in Africa and hunger afflicting children worldwide, we need socially responsible businesses that affect real change now more than ever."" Jackson said, ""I'm inspired by Clarke's vision and innovative approaches to tackling serious issues. It's our mission with Street King to really change children's lives around the world.""[98][99] In 2011 he founded SMS Audio, a consumer-electronics company selling Street by 50 headphones, pledging to donate a portion of their sales to charity.[100]

On July 13, 2015 Jackson filed for chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Hartford, Connecticut.[101]

Jackson has been involved in the mining and precious-metals industries. In 2008 he visited a platinum, palladium and iridium mine shaft in South Africa, and met with South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe. After his meeting with Motsepe, Jackson considered purchasing equity in the mine and launching 50 Cent-branded platinum.[102][103]

The rapper is involved in the American stock and real-estate markets, with a portfolio including stocks, bonds and real estate. In 2007 he was the second-wealthiest performer in the rap industry, behind Jay-Z.[104] Jackson, who lives in a Farmington, Connecticut mansion formerly owned by ex-boxer Mike Tyson,[105] has been ranked among the wealthiest figures of the American hip-hop scene.

A portion of his investments lost value during the 2008 recession.[106] In December 2008 he told the Canadian press that he had been affected by the recession, losing several million dollars in the stock market. Unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, Jackson postponed Before I Self-Destruct because of the economic downturn.[107] He was the fifth-richest figure in American hip hop in 2014, with an estimated net worth of $140 million.[108]

On July 21, 2012 Jackson announced that he had become a licensed boxing promoter for his new company, TMT (The Money Team). Licensed to promote in New York, he was in the process of being licensed in Nevada (where most major fights are held in the U.S.). A former amateur boxer, Jackson signed gold medalist and former featherweight champion Yuriorkis Gamboa and middleweight Olympic medalist Andre Dirrell.[109] On July 29, 2012 he and his friend, Floyd Mayweather, Jr., signed IBF featherweight champion Billy Dib. They unveiled plans to challenge the box-office dominance of mixed martial arts and change the landscape of boxing with TMT Promotions.[110] Boxer Zab Judah also expressed interest in making a deal with Jackson.[111] In December 2012 Mayweather and Jackson parted company, with Jackson taking over the promotion company and founding SMS Promotions[112] with Gamboa, Dirrell, Dib, James Kirkland, Luis Olivares and Donte Strayhorn in his stable.

Jackson has two sons. On October 13, 1997 Jackson's girlfriend, Shaniqua Tompkins, gave birth to son Marquise Jackson.[117][118] Tompkins later sued him for $50 million, saying that he said that he would take care of her for life. The suit, with 15 causes of action, was dismissed by a judge who called it ""an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour.""[119] As of February 2009, Tompkins and her lawyer were considering an appeal.[120][needs update?]

Marquise's birth changed Jackson's outlook on life: ""When my son came into my life, my priorities changed, because I wanted to have the relationship with him that I didn't have with my father"".[121] He credited his son for inspiring his career and being the ""motivation to go in a different direction"".[122] Jackson has a tattooed ""Marquise"" with an axe on his right bicep (""The axe is 'cause I'm a warrior. I don't want him to be one, though""),[29] and has ""50"", ""Southside"" and ""Cold World"" on his back: ""I'm a product of that environment. It's on my back, though, so it's all behind me"".[29]

Jackson dated model Daphne Joy and had his second son, Sire Jackson, with her, on September 1, 2012.[123][124][125] At just two years old, Sire modeled for Kidz Safe, a headphone brand for kids, earning $700,000 through his contract.[126]

He dated actress Vivica A. Fox for several months in 2003, announcing their breakup on The Howard Stern Show when their photos appeared on the cover of the magazine Today's Black Woman without his knowledge.[127][128] Jackson also dated comedienne Chelsea Handler [129] and singer Ciara.[130]

In 2005, Jackson supported President George W. Bush after rapper Kanye West criticized Bush for a slow response to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.[131] If his felony convictions did not prevent him from voting, he said, he would have voted for the president.[132] Jackson later said that Bush ""has less compassion than the average human. By all means, I don't aspire to be like George Bush.""[133] In September 2007 he told Time that although he would not endorse a candidate in 2008, he ""liked Hillary [Clinton]"".[134] Six months later the rapper told MTV News that he had switched his support to Barack Obama after hearing him speak, but had lost interest in politics.[135][136] Asked his opinion of President Obama's May 9, 2012 endorsement of gay marriage, Jackson said, ""I'm for it ... I've encouraged same-sex activities. I've engaged in fetish areas a couple times.""[137] He has been criticized for anti-gay comments in the past.[138][139][140]

Forbes noted Jackson's wealth in 2007, ranking him second behind Jay-Z in the rap industry.[104] He lives in a Farmington, Connecticut mansion formerly owned by ex-boxer Mike Tyson,[141] listing it for sale at $18.5 million to move closer to his son (who lives on Long Island with his ex-girlfriend).[142] The mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut declared October 12, 2007 ""50 Cent Curtis Jackson Day"", honoring the rapper with a proclamation and a key to the city.[143] One of Jackson's New York homes, purchased in January 2007 for $2.4 million and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 31, 2008 while he was filming in Louisiana.[144]

In December 2008 he told the Canadian press that he had lost several million dollars in the stock market and, unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, had postponed Before I Self-Destruct because of the economic downturn.[145] Jackson won a lawsuit in November 2009 against Taco Bell over the fast-food chain's use of his name without permission.[146]

On June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine and a starter's pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp (where he earned his high-school equivalency diploma). According to him, he did not use cocaine.[4][12][147] Jackson and four members of his entourage were arrested shortly before 2 a.m. on January 1, 2003, when police found a .25-caliber handgun and a .45-caliber pistol in a parked car (which they searched due to its tinted windows) outside a Manhattan nightclub. The rapper was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a weapon.[148] Jackson was sentenced to two years' probation on July 22, 2005 for a May 2004 incident, when he was charged with three counts of assault and battery after jumping into an audience when he was hit by a water bottle.[149]

Jackson filed a lawsuit against an advertising company, Traffix of Pearl River, New York, on July 21, 2007 for using his image in a promotion he said threatened his safety. He was alerted by a staff member to an Internet advertisement on a MySpace page. According to court documents, the advertisement had a cartoon image of the rapper with ""Shoot the rapper and you will win $5000 or five ring tones guaranteed"". Although the ad did not use his name, the image allegedly resembled him and suggested that he endorsed the product. The lawsuit, calling the ad a ""vile, tasteless and despicable"" use of Jackson's image which ""quite literally call[ed] for violence against him"", sought unspecified punitive damages and a permanent injunction against the use of his image without permission.[150][151]

One of his New York homes, purchased for $2.4 million in January 2007 and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 30, 2008 while he was filming in Louisiana.[144] On August 5, 2013, Jackson plead not guilty to one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism in a Los Angeles County court. If convicted of all charges, he faced up to five years in prison and $46,000 in fines. Model-actress Daphne Joy accused Jackson of kicking her and ransacking her bedroom during an argument at her condominium in the Toluca Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles on June 23. He allegedly caused $7,100 in property damage, leaving the scene before police arrived.[152]

On July 13, 2015, Jackson filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut.[153][154] On July 17, 2015, the Court issued an order allowing a creditor to proceed with the punitive damages phase of a trial against Jackson in a New York state court, in connection with the alleged release of a private video.[155]

Before he signed with Interscope Records Jackson engaged in a public dispute with rapper Ja Rule and his label, Murder Inc Records, saying that a friend robbed jewelry from Ja Rule and the latter accused him of orchestrating the robbery.[127] Ja Rule said that the conflict stemmed from a Queens video shoot, when Jackson did not like seeing him ""getting so much love"" from the neighborhood.[156] At The Hit Factory in New York in March 2000, Jackson had an altercation with Murder Inc. associates and received three stitches for a stab wound.[127][157] Rapper Black Child claimed responsibility for the stabbing, saying that he acted in self-defense when he thought someone reached for a gun.[158]

An affidavit by an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent suggested ties between Murder Inc. and Kenneth ""Supreme"" McGriff, a New York drug lord suspected of involvement in the murder of Jam Master Jay and Jackson's shooting. An excerpt read:

In an MTV interview, Ja Rule acknowledged his defeat by Jackson and said that his 2009 album, The Mirror, would not continue any feuds: ""There was a lot of things I wanted to say, and I didn't want there to be any bitter records on the album. Because I'm not bitter about anything that happened [in the past few years]"".[citation needed] The end of the Jackson-Ja Rule feud was confirmed in May 2011. According to Ja Rule, ""I'm cool. We ain't beefing no more. We'll never collaborate. That's just what it is. You don't have to be at war with somebody, but it's also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don't gotta go to war, but we're not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world. He's doing him, and he's not thinking about me, and I'm doing me and I'm not thinking about him.""[159]

Although Jackson was close to The Game before the latter released his debut album, The Documentary, they grew apart. After The Documentary‍ '​s release, Jackson felt that The Game was disloyal for saying that he did not want to participate in G-Unit's feuds with other rappers (such as Nas, Jadakiss and Fat Joe) and his desire to work with artists with which G-Unit was feuding. He said that he wrote six songs for the album and did not receive proper credit, which The Game denied.[160]

Jackson later dismissed The Game from G-Unit on Hot 97. After the announcement, The Game (a guest earlier in the evening) tried to enter the building with his entourage. After they were denied entry, one of his associates was shot in the leg in a confrontation with a group of men leaving the building.[161][162] When the situation escalated the rappers held a joint press conference announcing their reconciliation,[163] and fans were uncertain if the rappers had staged a publicity stunt to boost sales of their recently released albums.[164] After the situation cooled,[165] G-Unit criticized The Game's street credibility and announced that they would not appear on his albums. During a Summer Jam performance The Game announced a boycott of G-Unit, which he called ""G-Unot"".[166]

After the Summer Jam performance The Game recorded ""300 Bars and Runnin'"", an extended ""diss"" of G-Unit and Roc-A-Fella Records, for the mixtape You Know What It Is Vol. 3. Jackson responded with his ""Piggy Bank"" music video, with The Game as Mr. Potato Head and parodies of other rivals.[167] They have continued attacking each other, with The Game releasing two more mixtapes: Ghost Unit and a mixtape-DVD, Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin. Jackson superimposed The Game's head on the body of a male stripper for the cover of the Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Radio Part 21) mixtape in response to The Game's pictures of G-Unit dressed as the Village People.[168] The Game, under contract to Aftermath Entertainment, signed with Geffen Records to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit (although it is claimed that Jackson pressured Dr. Dre to fire him).[169] G-Unit member Spider Loc has insulted The Game in songs, and the latter released ""240 Bars (Spider Joke)"" and ""100 Bars (The Funeral)"" attacking G-Unit and Loc. Jackson's response was ""Not Rich, Still Lyin'"", mocking The Game.[170] Lloyd Banks replied to the Game on a Rap City freestyle-booth segment, followed by a Game ""diss"" song (""SoundScan"") ridiculing the 13-position drop of Banks' album Rotten Apple on the Billboard 200 chart and its disappointing second-week sales. Banks replied on his mixtape Mo' Money In The Bank Pt. 5: Gang Green Season Continues with ""Showtime (The Game's Over)"", said that Jackson wrote half of The Documentary and ridiculed The Game's suicidal thoughts.[citation needed]

In October 2006 The Game made a peace overture (which was not immediately answered) to Jackson,[171] but two days later he said on Power 106 that the peace offer was valid for only one day.[172] In several songs on Doctor's Advocate, he implied that the feud was over. He said in July 2009 that the feud had ended with help from Michael Jackson and Diddy,[173] and apologized for his actions.[174] According to Tony Yayo, neither Jackson nor G-Unit accepted his apology[175] and The Game has resumed his calls for a ""G-Unot"" boycott at concerts. Jackson released ""So Disrespectful"" on Before I Self Destruct, targeting Jay-Z, The Game and Young Buck.[176] The Game responded with ""Shake"", poking fun at the music video for Jackson's ""Candy Shop"".

Although Rick Ross began a feud with Jackson over an alleged incident at the January 2009 BET Awards, Jackson told news sources he did not remember seeing Ross there.[177] Late that month Ross' ""Mafia Music"" was leaked on the Internet, with lyrics apparently disparaging Jackson. Several days later, Jackson released ""Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)"" in response to ""Mafia Music"". The following day, Ross appeared on Shade 45 (Eminem's Sirius channel) and told Jackson to come up with something better in 24 hours.

Before leaving for Venezuela, Jackson uploaded a video (""Warning Shot"", telling Ross ""I'ma fuck your life up for fun""[citation needed]) and the first of a series of ""Officer Ricky"" cartoons. In early February he uploaded a YouTube video in which he interviewed ""Tia"", the mother of one of Ross' children; according to her, Ross is in reality a correctional officer.[178] On February 5, 2009, The Game phoned Seattle radio station KUBE. Asked about the dispute between Jackson and Ross, he sided with Jackson and offered to mediate: ""Rick Ross, holla at your boy, man"" and ""50 eating you, boy.""[179]

On his album Deeper Than Rap, Ross refers to Jackson in ""In Cold Blood"" and Jackson's mock funeral is part of the song's video. When the song was released, Ross said that he ended Jackson's career.[180] ""Rick Ross is Albert From CB4. You ever seen the movie? He's Albert,"" Jackson replied in an interview. ""It never gets worse than this. You get a guy that was a correctional officer come out and base his entire career on writing material from a drug dealer's perspective such as ""Freeway"" Ricky Ross.""[181] Their feud rekindled at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards, where Jackson and G-Unit members Kidd Kidd, Mike Knox, Tony Yayo were seen on video attacking Gunplay (a member of Ross' Maybach Music Group). Gunplay's Maybach Music diamond necklace was stolen during the brawl, and several days later Jackson appeared at a Washington, D.C. bowling alley wearing Gunplay's chain.[182] On January 30, 2013, Jackson tweeted that Ross' attempted drive-by shooting on his birthday three days earlier was ""staged"".[183]"

http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transactioncosts.asp	"Expenses incurred when buying or selling securities. Transaction costs include brokers' commissions and spreads (the difference between the price the dealer paid for a security and the price the buyer pays). The transaction costs to buyers and sellers are the payments that banks and brokers receive for their roles in these transactions. There are also transaction costs in buying and selling real estate. These fees include the agent's commission and closing costs such as title search fees, appraisal fees and government fees.

Transaction costs are important to investors because they are one of the key determinants of net returns. Transaction costs diminish returns, and over time, high transaction costs can mean thousands of dollars lost from not just the costs themselves but because the costs reduce the amount of capital available to invest. Fees, such as mutual fund expense ratios, have the same effect. Different asset classes have different ranges of standard transaction costs and fees. All else being equal, investors should select assets whose costs are at the low end of the range for their type."
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost	"In economics and related disciplines, a transaction cost is a cost incurred in making an economic exchange (restated: the cost of participating in a market).[1]

Transaction costs can be divided into three broad categories:[2]

For example, the buyer of a used car faces a variety of different transaction costs. The search costs are the costs of finding a car and determining the car's condition. The bargaining costs are the costs of negotiating a price with the seller. The policing and enforcement costs are the costs of ensuring that the seller delivers the car in the promised condition.

The idea that transactions form the basis of an economic thinking was introduced by the institutional economist John R. Commons (1931). He said that:

These individual actions are really trans-actions instead of either individual behavior or the ""exchange"" of commodities. It is this shift from commodities and individuals to transactions and working rules of collective action that marks the transition from the classical and hedonic schools to the institutional schools of economic thinking. The shift is a change in the ultimate unit of economic investigation. The classic and hedonic economists, with their communistic and anarchistic offshoots, founded their theories on the relation of man to nature, but institutionalism is a relation of man to man. The smallest unit of the classic economists was a commodity produced by labor. The smallest unit of the hedonic economists was the same or similar commodity enjoyed by ultimate consumers. One was the objective side, the other the subjective side, of the same relation between the individual and the forces of nature. The outcome, in either case, was the materialistic metaphor of an automatic equilibrium, analogous to the waves of the ocean, but personified as ""seeking their level."" But the smallest unit of the institutional economists is a unit of activity -- a transaction, with its participants. Transactions intervene between the labor of the classic economists and the pleasures of the hedonic economists,simply because it is society that controls access to the forces of nature, and transactions are, not the ""exchange of commodities,"" but the alienation and acquisition, between individuals, of the rights of property and liberty created by society, which must therefore be negotiated between the parties concerned before labor can produce, or consumers can consume, or commodities be physically exchanged"".

The term ""transaction cost"" is frequently thought to have been coined by Ronald Coase, who used it to develop a theoretical framework for predicting when certain economic tasks would be performed by firms, and when they would be performed on the market. However, the term is actually absent from his early work up to the 1970s. While he did not coin the specific term, Coase indeed discussed ""costs of using the price mechanism"" in his 1937 paper The Nature of the Firm, where he first discusses the concept of transaction costs, and refers to the ""Costs of Market Transactions"" in his seminal work, The Problem of Social Cost (1960). The term ""Transaction Costs"" itself can instead be traced back to the monetary economics literature of the 1950s, and does not appear to have been consciously 'coined' by any particular individual.[3]

Arguably, transaction cost reasoning became most widely known through Oliver E. Williamson's Transaction Cost Economics. Today, transaction cost economics is used to explain a number of different behaviours. Often this involves considering as ""transactions"" not only the obvious cases of buying and selling, but also day-to-day emotional interactions, informal gift exchanges, etc. Oliver E. Williamson was awarded the 2009 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics[4]

According to Williamson, the determinants of transaction costs are frequency, specificity, uncertainty, limited rationality, and opportunistic behavior.

At least two definitions of the phrase ""transaction cost"" are commonly used in literature. Transaction costs have been broadly defined by Steven N. S. Cheung as any costs that are not conceivable in a ""Robinson Crusoe economy""—in other words, any costs that arise due to the existence of institutions. For Cheung, if the term ""transaction costs"" were not already so popular in economics literatures, they should more properly be called ""institutional costs"".[5][6] But many economists seem to restrict the definition to exclude costs internal to an organization.[7] The latter definition parallels Coase's early analysis of ""costs of the price mechanism"" and the origins of the term as a market trading fee.

Starting with the broad definition, many economists then ask what kind of institutions (firms, markets, franchises, etc.) minimize the transaction costs of producing and distributing a particular good or service. Often these relationships are categorized by the kind of contract involved. This approach sometimes goes under the rubric of New Institutional Economics.

A supplier may bid in a very competitive environment with a customer to build a widget. However, to make the widget, the supplier will be required to build specialized machinery which cannot be easily redeployed to make other products. Once the contract is awarded to the supplier, the relationship between customer and supplier changes from a competitive environment to a monopoly,monopsony relationship, known as a bilateral monopoly. This means that the customer has greater leverage over the supplier such as when price cuts occur. To avoid these potential costs, ""hostages"" may be swapped to avoid this event. These hostages could include partial ownership in the widget factory; revenue sharing might be another way.

Car companies and their suppliers often fit into this category, with the car companies forcing price cuts on their suppliers. Defense suppliers and the military appear to have the opposite problem, with cost overruns occurring quite often. Technologies like enterprise resource planning (ERP) can provide technical support for these strategies.

Williamson argues in The Mechanisms of Governance (1996) that Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) differs from neoclassical microeconomics in the following six points:"
http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/transaction-cost.html	"Hidden Costs Count Just as Much

""Whether you're trying to reduce your own business transaction costs or devise a new way that others can do business more frictionlessly, it's important to factor in all the costs of transactions, some of which tend to be less visible than others. These include the costs of search, information, negotiation, decision-making, policing, and enforcement, just to name a few."""

What do British people(either living in the United States or in the U.K.) think about the United States Independence Day Celebration? 



 Are you indifferent? Does it upset you - like rubbing salt in a wound? I'm curious - because a lot of people forget what we are celebrating - and to put it bluntly - we declared ourselves independent from a major world power and then proceeded to defeat them in a long drawn out war. 



 Does this bother current day U.K. subjects or ex-patriates? Is it considered a demonstration of American ""arrogance""? Or do not care? What do you think? 



 Great Britain is a case study for Arrogance!



 Is it considered a demonstration of American ""arrogance""? Or do not care? What do you think? The British don't care.Great Britain is a case study for Arrogance! Why would they care?

 They're going on living their lives.

 The world doesn't revolve around the US.



 Funny, I end up in London almost every 4 July. My daughter celebrated with bunch of Brits tonight, here in the USA. They like to party. My British friends very kindly wished me and other American friends a happy Independence Day. I don't think it is something they lose sleep over. Don't know and don't care.



 Frankly, i don't think they contemplate it much. You know...because Brits tend to actually have a life. They don't really care , I don't think they think about it all. Many restaurants and clubs use the 4th of July as an excuse to have American theme parties. It certainly not seen as a reminder of the War of Independence which was a long time ago....



 We have lives, we just get on with them and if a party is thrown we enjoy it ! The Brits living in England don't care, and the ones living here use the day-off as an excuse to get drunk.

http://www.city-data.com/knowledge/Great_Britain.html	"Great Britain or Britain (Welsh: Prydain Fawr, Scottish Gaelic: Breatainn Mhòr, Cornish: Breten Veur) is an island situated to the northwest of Continental Europe. It is the ninth largest island in the world, and the largest European island, as well as the largest of the British Isles. With a population of about 60.0 million people in mid-2009, it is the third most populous island in the world, after Java and Honshū. Great Britain is surrounded by over 1,000 smaller islands and islets. The island of Ireland lies to its west. Politically, Great Britain may also refer to the island itself together with a number of surrounding islands which comprise the territory of England, Scotland and Wales.Unknown extension tag ""ref""

All of the island is territory of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and most of the United Kingdom's territory is in Great Britain. Most of England, Scotland, and Wales are on the island of Great Britain, as are their respective capital cities: London, Edinburgh, and Cardiff.

The Kingdom of Great Britain resulted from the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland with the Acts of Union 1707 on 1 May 1707 under Queen Anne. In 1801, under a new Act of Union, this kingdom merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. After the Irish War of Independence most of Ireland seceded from the Union, which then became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The relatively limited variety of fauna and flora on the island is due to its size and the fact that wildlife has had little time to develop since the last glacial period. The high level of urbanisation on the island has contributed to a species extinction rate that is about 100 times greater than the background species extinction rate.

Main articles: Kingdom of Great Britain and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

Great Britain is the largest island of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Politically, Great Britain refers to England, Scotland and Wales in combination, and therefore also includes a number of outlying islands such as the Isle of Wight, Anglesey, the Isles of Scilly, the Hebrides, and the island groups of Orkney and Shetland. It does not include the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands which are not part of the United Kingdom, instead being self-governing dependent territories of that state with their own legislative and taxation systems.

The political union that joined the kingdoms of England and Scotland happened in 1707 when the Acts of Union ratified the 1706 Treaty of Union and merged the parliaments of the two nations, forming the Kingdom of Great Britain, which covered the entire island. Prior to this, a personal union had existed between these two countries since the 1603 Union of the Crowns under James VI of Scotland and I of England.

Great Britain lies to the northwest of Continental Europe and east of Ireland. It is separated from the continent by the North Sea and by the English Channel, which narrows to 34 kilometres (21 mi) at the Straits of Dover. It stretches over about ten degrees of latitude on its longer, north-south axis, and occupies an area of 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi), excluding all the smaller surrounding islands of the archipelago. The North Channel, Irish Sea, St George's Channel and Celtic Sea separate the island from the island of Ireland to its west. The island is physically connected with continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel, the longest undersea rail tunnel in the world which was completed in 1993. Geographically, the island is marked by low, rolling countryside in the east and south, while hills and mountains predominate in the western and northern regions. It is surrounded by over 1,000 smaller islands and islets. The greatest distance between two points is 968 km , 601.5 miles (between Land's End, Cornwall and John O'Groats, Caithness), or 1,349 km , 838 miles using the national road network.

The English Channel is thought to have been created between 450,000 and 180,000 years ago by two catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods caused by the breaching of the Weald-Artois Anticline, a ridge which held back a large proglacial lake, now submerged under the North Sea. Around 10,000 years ago, during the Devensian glaciation with its lower sea level, Great Britain was not an island, but an upland region of northwestern Europe, lying partially underneath the Eurasian ice sheet. The sea level was about 120 metres (390 ft) lower than today, and the bed of the North Sea was dry and acted as a land bridge to Europe, now known as Doggerland. It is generally thought that as sea levels gradually rose after the end of the last glacial period of the current ice age, Doggerland became submerged beneath the North Sea, cutting off what was previously the British peninsula from the European mainland by around 6500 BC.

Main articles: History of England, History of Scotland, History of Wales, and History of the United Kingdom

The island was first inhabited by people who crossed over the land bridge from the European mainland. Traces of early humans have been found (at Boxgrove Quarry, Sussex) from some 500,000 years ago and modern humans from about 30,000 years ago. Until about 10,000 years ago, Great Britain was joined to Ireland, and as recently as 8,000 years ago it was joined to the continent by a strip of low marsh to what is now Denmark and the Netherlands. In Cheddar Gorge, near Bristol, the remains of animal species native to mainland Europe such as antelopes, brown bears, and wild horses have been found alongside a human skeleton, 'Cheddar Man', dated to about 7150 BC. Thus, animals and humans must have moved between mainland Europe and Great Britain via a crossing. Great Britain became an island at the end of the Pleistocene ice age when sea levels rose due to isostatic depression of the crust and the melting of glaciers.

According to John T. Koch and others, Britain in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal where Celtic languages developed, but this stands in contrast to the more generally accepted view that Celtic origins lie with the Hallstatt culture.

Its Iron Age inhabitants are known as the Britons, a group speaking a Celtic language. The Romans conquered most of the island (up to Hadrian's Wall, in northern England) and this became the Ancient Roman province of Britannia. For 500 years after the Roman Empire fell, the Britons of the south and east of the island were assimilated or displaced by invading Germanic tribes (Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, often referred to collectively as Anglo-Saxons). At about the same time, Gaelic tribes from Ireland invaded the north-west, absorbing both the Picts and Britons of northern Britain, eventually forming the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century. The south-east of Scotland was colonised by the Angles and formed, until 1018, a part of the Kingdom of Northumbria. Ultimately, the population of south-east Britain came to be referred to, after the Angles, as the English people.

Germanic speakers referred to Britons as Welsh. This term eventually came to be applied exclusively to the inhabitants of what is now Wales, but it also survives in names such as Wallace, and in the second syllable of Cornwall. Cymry, a name the Britons used to describe themselves, is similarly restricted in modern Welsh to people from Wales, but also survives in English in the place name of Cumbria. The Britons living in the areas now known as Wales, Cumbria and Cornwall were not assimilated by the Germanic tribes, a fact reflected in the survival of Celtic languages in these areas into more recent times. At the time of the Germanic invasion of Southern Britain, many Britons emigrated to the area now known as Brittany, where Breton, a Celtic language closely related to Welsh and Cornish and descended from the language of the emigrants, is still spoken. In the 9th century, a series of Danish assaults on northern English kingdoms led to them coming under Danish control (an area known as the Danelaw). In the 10th century, however, all the English kingdoms were unified under one ruler as the kingdom of England when the last constituent kingdom, Northumbria, submitted to Edgar in 959. In 1066, England was conquered by the Normans, who introduced a French ruling élite that was eventually assimilated. Wales came under Anglo-Norman control in 1282, and was officially annexed to England in the 16th century.

On 20 October 1604 King James, who had succeeded separately to the two thrones of England and Scotland, proclaimed himself as ""King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland"". While that title was also used by many of his successors, England and Scotland each remained legally in existence as separate countries with their own parliaments until 1707, when each parliament passed an Act of Union to ratify the Treaty of Union that had been agreed the previous year. This had the effect of creating a united kingdom, with a single, united parliament, from 1 May 1707. Though the Treaty of Union referred to the new all-island state as the ""United Kingdom of Great Britain"", many regard the term 'United Kingdom' as being descriptive of the union rather than part of its formal name (which the Treaty stated was to be 'Great Britain' without further qualification.) Most reference books, therefore, describe the all-island kingdom that existed between 1707 and 1800 as the ""Kingdom of Great Britain"".

The oldest mention of terms related to the formal name of Britain was made by Aristotle (c. 384–322 BC), in his text On the Universe, Vol. III. To quote his works, ""There are two very large islands in it, called the British Isles, Albion and lerne"". The archipelago has been referred to by a single name for over 2,000 years: the term British Isles derives from terms used by classical geographers to describe this island group. Pliny the Elder (c. 23–79 AD) in his Natural History (iv.xvi.102) records of Great Britain: ""It was itself named Albion, while all the islands about which we shall soon briefly speak were called the Britanniae.""

The earliest known name of Great Britain is Albion (Ἀλβίων) or insula Albionum, from either the Latin albus meaning white (referring to the white cliffs of Dover, the first view of Britain from the continent) or the ""island of the Albiones"", first mentioned in the Massaliote Periplus and by Pytheas.

The name Britain descends from the Latin name for Britain, Britannia or Brittānia, the land of the Britons. Old French Bretaigne (whence also Modern French Bretagne) and Middle English Bretayne, авBreteyne. The French form replaced the Old English Breoton, Breoten, Bryten, Breten (also Breoton-lond, Breten-lond). Britannia was used by the Romans from the 1st century BC for the British Isles taken together. It is derived from the travel writings of the ancient Greek Pytheas around 320 BC, which described various islands in the North Atlantic as far north as Thule (probably Norway).

The peoples of these islands of Prettanike were called the Πρέττανοι, Priteni or Pretani. Priteni is the source of the Welsh language term Prydain, Britain, which has the same source as the Goidelic term Cruithne used to refer to the early Brythonic speaking inhabitants of Ireland. The latter were later called Picts or Caledonians by the Romans.

After the Anglo-Saxon period, Britain was used as a historical term only. Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical Historia Regum Britanniae (c. 1136) refers to the island of Great Britain as Britannia major (""Greater Britain""), to distinguish it from Britannia minor (""Lesser Britain""), the continental region which approximates to modern Brittany. The term Great Britain was first used officially in 1474, in the instrument drawing up the proposal for a marriage between Cecily the daughter of Edward IV of England, and James the son of James III of Scotland, which described it as ""this Nobill Isle, callit Gret Britanee."" As noted above it was used again in 1604, when King James VI and I styled himself ""King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland.""

The term Great Britain can refer either to the largest island within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or to England, Scotland and Wales as a unit (including many smaller islands associated with these three countries). It does not include Northern Ireland.

The term Britain, as opposed to Great Britain, has been used to mean the United Kingdom, for example in official government yearbooks between 1975 and 2001. Since 2002, however, the yearbooks have only used the term ""United Kingdom"".

The initials GB or GBR are used in some international codes instead of the initials UK to refer to the United Kingdom. Examples include: Universal Postal Union , international sports teams, NATO, the International Organization for Standardization country codes ISO 3166-2 and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3, and international licence plate codes.

On the Internet, .uk is used as a country code top-level domain for the United Kingdom. A .gb top-level domain was also used to a limited extent in the past, but this is now effectively obsolete because the domain name registrar will not take new registrations.

Animal diversity is modest, as a result of factors including the island's small land area, the relatively recent age of the habitats developed since the last Ice Age and the island's physical separation from continental Europe, and the effects of seasonal variability. Great Britain also experienced early industrialisation and is subject to continuing urbanisation, which have contributed towards the overall loss of species. A DEFRA study from 2006 suggested that 100 species have become extinct in the UK during the 20th century, about 100 times the background extinction rate. However, some species, such as the brown rat, red fox, and introduced grey squirrel, are well adapted to urban areas.

Rodents make up 40% of the total number of mammal species in Great Britain. These include squirrels, mice, voles, rats and the recently reintroduced European beaver. There is also an abundance of rabbits, hares, hedgehogs, shrews, moles and several species of bat. Carnivorous mammals include the fox, badger, otter, weasel, stoat and elusive wildcat. Various species of seal, whale and dolphin are found on or around British shores and coastlines. The largest land-based wild animals today are deer. The red deer is the largest species, with roe deer and fallow deer also prominent; the latter was introduced by the Normans. Sika deer and two more species of smaller deer, muntjac and Chinese water deer, have been introduced, muntjac becoming widespread in England and parts of Wales while Chinese water deer are restricted mainly to East Anglia. Habitat loss has affected many species. Extinct large mammals include the brown bear, grey wolf and wild boar; the latter has had a limited reintroduction in recent times.

There is a wealth of birdlife in Britain, 583 species in total, of which 258 breed on the island or remain during winter. Because of its mild winters for its latitude, Great Britain hosts important numbers of many wintering species, particularly ducks, geese and swans. Other well known bird species include the golden eagle, grey heron, kingfisher, pigeon, sparrow, pheasant, partridge, and various species of crow, finch, gull, auk, grouse, owl and falcon. There are six species of reptile on the island; three snakes and three lizards including the legless slow worm. One snake, the adder, is venomous but rarely deadly. Amphibians present are frogs, toads and newts.

List of the vascular plants of Britain and Ireland

In a similar sense to fauna, and for similar reasons, the flora of Great Britain is impoverished compared to that of continental Europe. Great Britain's flora comprises 3,354 vascular plant species, of which 2,297 are native and 1,057 have been introduced into the island. The island has a wide variety of trees, including native species of birch, beech, ash, hawthorn, elm, oak, yew, pine, cherry and apple. Other trees have been naturalised, introduced especially from other parts of Europe (particularly Norway) and North America. Introduced trees include several varieties of pine, chestnut, maple, spruce, sycamore and fir, as well as cherry plum and pear trees. The tallest species are the Douglas firs; two specimens have been recorded measuring 65 metres or 212 feet. The Fortingall Yew in Perthshire is the oldest tree in Europe.

There are at least 1,500 different species of wildflower in Britain, Some 107 species are particularly rare or vulnerable and are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It is illegal to uproot any wildflowers without the landowner's permission. A vote in 2002 nominated various wildflowers to represent specific counties. These include red poppies, bluebells, daisies, daffodils, rosemary, gorse, iris, ivy, mint, orchids, brambles, thistles, buttercups, primrose, thyme, tulips, violets, cowslip, heather and many more. There are also many species of algae, lichens, fungi and mosses across the island.

Main articles: Religion in England, Religion in Scotland, and Religion in Wales

Christianity is the largest religion on the island and has been since the Early Middle Ages, though its existence on the island dates back to the Roman introduction in antiquity and continued through Early Insular Christianity. The largest form practised in present day Britain is Anglicanism (also known as Episcopalism in Scotland); dating from the 16th century Reformation, the religion regards itself as both Catholic and Reformed. Head of the Church is the monarch of the United Kingdom as the Supreme Governor. It has the status of established church in England. There are just over 26 million adherents to Anglicanism in Britain today, although the number of active adherents (those who regularly attend services) is only around one million. The second largest Christian practice in Britain is the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church which traces its formal, corporate history in Great Britain to the 6th century with Augustine's mission and was the main religion on the island for around a thousand years. There are over 5 million adherents in Britain today; 4.5 million in England and Wales and 750,000 in Scotland, although less than a million Catholics regularly attend mass.

The Church of Scotland, a form of Protestantism with a Presbyterian system of ecclesiastical polity is the third most numerous on the island with around 2.1 million members. Introduced in Scotland by clergyman John Knox, it has the status of national church in Scotland. The monarch of the United Kingdom is represented prominently by a Lord High Commissioner. Methodism is the fourth largest and grew out of Anglicanism through John Wesley. It gained popularity in the old mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire, also amongst tin miners in Cornwall. The Presbyterian Church of Wales, which follow Calvinistic Methodism, is the largest denomination in Wales. There are other non-conformist minorities, such as Baptists, Quakers, the United Reformed Church (a union of Congregationalists and English Presbyterians), Unitarians and more. The first patron saint of Great Britain was Saint Alban. He was the first Christian martyr dating from the Romano-British period, condemned to death for his faith and was sacrificed to the pagan gods. In more recent times, some have suggested the adoption of Saint Aidan as another patron saint of Britain. Originally from Ireland, he worked at Iona amongst the Dál Riata and then Lindisfarne where he restored Christianity to Northumbria.

Three constituent countries of the United Kingdom located on the island have patron saints; Saint George and Saint Andrew are represented in the flags of England and Scotland respectively. These two saintly flags combined form the basis of the Great Britain royal flag of 1604. Saint David is the patron saint of Wales. There are many other British saints, some of the best known include; Cuthbert, Columba, Patrick, Margaret, Edward the Confessor, Mungo, Thomas More, Petroc, Bede and Thomas Becket.

Numerous non-Christian religions are practised in Great Britain. Judaism has a history of a small minority on the island since 1070. The Jews were expelled from England in 1290 until being allowed to return in 1656. Their history in Scotland is quite obscure until later migrations from Lithuania. Especially since the 1950s religions from the former colonies have become more prevalent; Islam is the most common of these with around 1.5 million adherents in Britain. A total of more than 1 million people practise either Hinduism, Sikhism or Buddhism, religions introduced from India and South East Asia.

The capitals of the three countries of the United Kingdom which comprise Great Britain are:

The largest cities in Great Britain by urban area population (not including the capital cities listed above) are Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield."

An Independence Day is an annual event commemorating the anniversary of a nation's independence. statehood, usually after ceasing to be a group or part of another nation or state; more rarely after the end of a military occupation. Most countries observe their respective independence days as a national holiday.

The following is a partial list of independence days of countries around the world:
